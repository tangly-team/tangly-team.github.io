      <description>Invoices Model Concepts Invoices define a business-bounded domain as defined in domain-driven design approach. They are not constrained through external entities such as products, contracts or legal entities. External entities can provide hints to streamline the creation of regular invoices. The invoice article identifier is available as an external identifier to the article bounded domain. Similar identifiers are available for legal entities.&#xA;The currency is defined at the invoice level, meaning all invoice items and subtotals should use the same currency.</description>
