<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Increased Reusability</dt>
<dd>
<p>For large development teams, developing modular components of an application helps to increase reusability.
Modular components can be reused and repurposed and can help teams establish a single source of truth.
This can lead to faster and more consistent development.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Better-Organized Dependencies</dt>
<dd>
<p>Because modular monoliths make individual functions more independent, they, by nature, make dependencies more organized and visible.
This makes it easier for developers to easily assess which parts of the application require which dependencies.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Increased Observability</dt>
<dd>
<p>Developing with modularity in mind means code is more accessible to developers.
For Java developers in particular, interface classes and their requisite javadoc comments help to enhance accessibility and interoperability for developers who may need to work with the modularized function.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any time a developer is working on a monolithic application, using principles of modularity can help them to improve the processes for their team.
Whether that means making dependencies more manageable within the application, improving developer interoperability on the modular components of that application, or adding modular components to the house repository, embracing modularity can have a positive impact on teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the application itself, embracing modularity can help to organize dependencies, making it easier and less time-consuming to change components within the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good practices shall be applied to refactor the application [<a href="#clean-code">1</a>, <a href="#clean-architecture">2</a>, <a href="#refactoring">3</a>, <a href="#refactoring-databases">4</a>].</p>

<p>If you are like many Java developers who are still working on a monolithic application, then employing modularization best practices can help make your application achieve some benefits of microservices without the associated cost of refactoring.</p>

<p>Great technologies, programming languages and tools are used when building software applications.
That is good and right.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But unfortunately, it is often lost that the decisive factor for the success of a project is not technology, but the solution.
In order to understand the subject matter or domain, we need a common language with the domain experts and users.
If we do not map the technical model in the software and its architecture, it will not help our users in their work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a computer scientist, it is easy to fall into the trap of focusing on technology instead of specialist knowledge
footnoote:[In the modern trend of technology driven curriculum this dreadful approach is often encountered].
The principle of bounded contexts from DDD can help us here.</p>

<p>Domain-driven design (DDD) is a useful approach that provides excellent guidelines for modeling and building systems, but it is a means to an end, not an end in itself.</p>

<p>The Java classes defined in the <a href="https://unitsofmeasurement.github.io/">JSR-385</a> specification are not limited to science, physics or math alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result, the terms quantity and unit of measure should be used in their general terminology, such as physical quantity or physical unit of measure, unless otherwise specified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This generalization holds true even if the Units of Measurement API was originally designed with scientific or physical quantities as the primary goal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The names and terms used in the specification are:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Dimension</dt>
<dd>
<p>Dimension is one of the fundamental aspects of quantity, including length, mass, time or combinations thereof.
The concept of measure expresses a characteristic without any concept of size.
So we can talk about length without any implication.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Quantity</dt>
<dd>
<p>Any kind of quantitative property or attribute of a thing.
Mass, time, distance, heat, longitude or latitude are among the familiar examples of quantitative properties.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>No unit of measure is required to express a quantity, nor does one need specific arithmetic to do so.
Alice can quantify the size of her shoes by picking them up.
Alice can add the mass of her left shoe and the mass of her right shoe by placing them both in the bowl of a scale.
Quantities can be measurable or dimensionless: the number of Alice’s shoes is a dimensionless quantity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Units of measure are required to represent measurable quantities on a computer, on paper, on a network, device, etc.
Two or more of these specifications do not mandate the use of a particular quantity as a standard unit of measure.
Therefore, SI (System-International) is usually used so that the standard system of units of measurement is suitable for most applications.
According to the JSR-385 API specification, 7 quantities should be acceptable if they have the same dimensions so that they can be compared with one another in a meaningful way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Unit</dt>
<dd>
<p>A unit, or unit of measure, is a quantity that is assumed to be the standard with a unique value that can be used to express.
The same type units of measurement are used as a comparison value.
For example, one foot corresponds to a quantity of 0.3048 meters.
Regardless of how this came about, a unit of measure can be expressed as the quantity of other units of measure of the same kind.</p>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Base-Unit</dt>
<dd>
<p>The base unit is a well-defined unit of measurement that is defined as being dimensionally independent of other basic units of measurement.
The SI system defines only 7 basic units of measurement (including meters, kilograms and seconds) from which all other SI units of measurement are derived.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Derived-Unit</dt>
<dd>
<p>Derived-Unit is a unit of measurement formed as the product of the results of basic units of measurement.
Some derived units of measurement have been given a special name and a symbol for convenience and ease of use.
In the SI system, special name derived units of measurement include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz">Hertz</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)">Newtons</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt">Volts</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">System-of-Units</dt>
<dd>
<p>A system of units is a set of basic and derived units of measure chosen as standards for specifying measures.
Examples are the SI (metric) and the imperial (English) system.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Prefix (multiplier)</dt>
<dd>
<p>A prefix is a leading word that can be applied to a unit of measure to form a decimal multiplication or decrease of the unit of measure.
Prefixes are used in the SI system, which includes kilo-, centi-, mili- etc.
Other cultures and regions use multiplier systems of a similar type, some of which differ from the SI system.
Examples are the separate use of multipliers such as Lakh- (100,000) or Crore- (10 million) in countries like India or parts of the Middle East.
This can be attributed to the fact that different currency systems exist.
It can also be traced back to historical number systems, which differ from the Latin or Arabic origin of today’s western systems in some areas or are absent in these in the same form.
On the other hand, the use of others, such as a dozen, is almost unknown there.</p>

<p>DevOps is intended to be a cross-functional mode of working [<a href="#accelerate">1</a>, <a href="#devops-handbook">2</a>, <a href="#phoenix-project">3</a>].
Practitioners use different toolchains rather than a single one.
These toolchains are expected to fit into one or more of the following categories, reflective of key aspects of the development and delivery process.</p>

<p>The areas that a DevOps engineer must be competent are:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Version Control Systems</dt>
<dd>
<p>Any DevOps engineer’s has expertise in Git, and platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
Infrastructure as Code <em>IaC</em> is used to build and deploy digital products.
Documentation is always synchronized with the source artifacts.
Approaches such as static websites are preferred.</p>

<dd>
<p>As for this one, you should look for Jenkins, TeamCity, GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
All products are built and packaged using continuous integration and continuous delivery approaches.
No manual steps are required to package a release for production.
It is important to note, however, that there are so many DevOps tools out there that it is impossible to cover them.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Testing and Automation Tools</dt>
<dd>
<p>One of the duties of a DevOps engineer is to speed up the delivery of software to the clients.
Most companies care about the quality of their software and testing has become an essential part of DevOps engineers&#39; job.
Functional and non-functional testing techniques and tools are used to guaranty quality of the installed solutions.
It provides the obvious benefits of automation, and helps DevOps engineers save a lot of time.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Containers and Cloud Services</dt>
<dd>
<p>Containers such as Docker and Kubernetes are used to deploy digital solutions.
Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services are some examples.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Communication</dt>
<dd>
<p>DevOps is not isolated to a specific role or to a specific team in your organization.
A DevOps specialist must have well-developed empathy because their job implies communication with other people.
Conflicts are not going to help them.
Deep understanding of empiricism and transparency of all available information and measurements is a must for successful communication in an agile and DevOps environment.</p>

<h3 id="_cultural_change">Cultural change</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DevOps initiatives create cultural changes in companies by transforming the way operations, developers and testers collaborate during the development and delivery processes.
Getting these groups to work cohesively is a critical challenge in enterprise adoption.
DevOps is as much about culture, the toolchains are only instruments to implement the approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Organizational culture is a strong predictor of IT and organizational performance.
Cultural practices such as information flow, collaboration, shared responsibilities, learning from failures and encouraging new ideas are central to DevOps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Team-building and other employee engagement activities are often used to create an environment that fosters this communication and cultural change within an organization.
DevOps as a service approach allows developers and operations teams to take greater control of their applications and infrastructure without hindering speed.
It also transfers the onus of owning a problem on to the development team, making them much more careful in their stride.</p>

<p>SoDa <em>Software Development Agile</em> is a homebrew project development method created at the <a href="https://www.hslu.ch">technical university of Lucerne</a>.
It is a mixture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process">RUP</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a> approaches.
It uses a distorted Scrum for the concept and implementation phase<a href="#detecting-agile-bullshit">[2]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The documentation was not updated the last ten years.
The approach is clinically dead and should not be promoted for active software development efforts.</p>

<p>A similar approach exists with the official governmental Swiss project method <a href="https://www.hermes.admin.ch/en/">HERMES</a>.
At least the documentation of <a href="https://www.hermes.admin.ch/en/starting-page.html">Hermes</a> is better than SoDa.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both approaches are quite similar.
They mix a phase-based Waterfall approach with the four phases of the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process">RUP</a> project life-cycle approach.
RUP belongs to the family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Process">unified process methods</a>.</p>

<h3 id="_why_hybrid_methods_are_hindering">Why Hybrid Methods are Hindering</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In his mind-expanding book <em>The Beginning of Infinity</em>, physicist David Deutsch describes science and the enlightenment as the quest for <em>good explanations</em>.
He explains how various ideas in human history represent a <em>beginning of infinity</em> that allows us to cope with any conceivable relevant application of these good explanations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This idea of infinite reach or scope is true of an agile approach to development and not true of a waterfall-based approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An agile approach to software development encourages us to start work on solving problems in smaller pieces.
It encourages us to begin work before we know the answer to everything.
This approach allows us to make progress, maybe sometimes in suboptimal or even bad directions, but nevertheless, after each step, we learn something new.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This does not mean that agile thinking is perfect or the final answer.
Rather, it is an important, significant, enabling step in the direction of better performance.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>SAFe is complex and less agile.
It contains waterfall elements.
Their approach to software architecture is outdated and does not reflect the findings of OpenGroup, the steward of TOGAF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/agile-release-train/">Agile release trains</a> should align teams to a shared business and technology mission.
The ideal size of a train is between 50 and 125 people working on the same product family.
Most product development initiatives are smaller.
ALl members of a train shall work on the same products.
Using the same technology stack is not a criteria to belong to the same train.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SAFe is not based or using Scrum.
Their definition of Scrum master and product owner is different to the ones in <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/">Scrum Guide</a>.
Their key roles of a release train engineer <em>RTE</em> and product management do not exist in Scrum.
They are more traditional project management roles.
All synergy effects are lost.
You must retrain your collaborators into SAFe if you go down this path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The planning and release cycle is a program increment.
The duration is typically 8 to 12 weeks long.
This is too long for agile, DevOps, or Design Thinking approaches.</p>

<p>Business agility is not compatible with hybrid approaches.
Use Lean startup or design thinking frameworks to increase your business agility and adapt to market changes.
Design thinking advocates iterations of one week duration.
Therefore, product increments of three months or worst RUP phases over half a year are truly incompatible with weekly cycle-time.</p>

<p>Of course, Groovy is not a perfect tool for every application.
Great in script-like, Groovy is not necessarily equally useful in normal, production coding.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clojure is brilliant in the support of dynamic dispatch at runtime.
The refined design of their collections is a proof of their support for functional approaches.
I am not convinced that dynamic inheritance and protocols promote maintainability of software products.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java is slowly moving to improve their support:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Switch expressions are now more functional.
In Spring 2022, deconstruction of records, objects and arrays is still not available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First class citizen status for functions is still ongoing.
You still not define the implementation of a virtual method using the lambda notation or a method reference.
I agree it is a detail.
But it is a signal if you want to truly support functional approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice is the effort to improve the collections.
The sequence interface would improve the legibility of the standard collections.
It is still a hack that unmodifiable collection throws an exception if your code calls a modifier.
It is time to introduce an unmodifiable interface for the various collections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Groovy is awesome in how operator support enhances the legibility of the source code.
The implementation is syntactic sugar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java libraries are best of breed.
Backward compatibility and static type checks are immensely helpful for enterprise applications developed over decades.
You do not want to throw away such a huge investment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I like properties and the elegance of grouping the declaration of the field with the methods.
I am still not certain it makes the code quite more legible or maintainable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to write a functional code with immutable objects, the availability of a with construct is a huge improvement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Functional programming with sequences is well-supported in all three environments.
Clojure has the edge.
The language is dynamically typed and provides sequence handling for all collections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java is statically type.
You need first to convert a collection into a stream.
Easy to do, but you have to write the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And as an engineer, I truly acknowledge the performance edge of Java against Clojure or Groovy.
Newer approaches based on GraalVM should close the performance gap in the future.</p>

<h3 id="_recommendations_for_a_java_developer">Recommendations for A Java Developer</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java 8 and functional features were introduced in March 2014.
Every Java programmer should now be a functional programming expert.
Here are some idioms you should use:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Embrace functional programming and use the stream approach for all collection traversals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop using iterations to process sequences.
Please use streams.
Declare your intent, do not describe the implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return <em>Optional&lt;T&gt;</em> or an empty list <em>Collections.emptyList()</em>.
Please do not return null values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create predicates using <em>java.util.function.predicate&lt;T&gt;</em> instead of complex boolean conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to compose functions through the helper methods of the <em>java.util.function</em> package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <em>switch</em> expression and the ternary operator <em>?:</em>.
Please avoid <em>if</em> and <em>switch</em> statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throw only unchecked exceptions.
Stop creating and throwing checked exceptions.
Beware that stream and lambda expressions cannot handle checked exceptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embrace immutability and the <em>record</em> construct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand deconstruction patterns and how you could apply them in our code.</p>
</li>

<p>The dreaded attack through the log4j logging library was a wake-up call for all companies using obsolete libraries.
Many organizations found out the hard way they cannot update the library and deploy the new version in a matter of minutes as professional developers should do.
They needed weeks to perform such a simple activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They also found out that they had no process for such regular situations when a critical flaw is detected in some software they are using.
Seldom did they have the expertise how to upgrade or improve open source artifacts they are using on a daily basis.

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a> and <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a> frameworks are the standard for enterprise Java applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications that you can just run.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries, so you can get started with minimum fuss.
Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_minimize_boilerplate_code">Minimize Boilerplate Code</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the key reasons for the success of Spring is the approach of <em>convention over configuration</em>.
You want to minimize boilerplate code and never have to write XML configuration files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of approaches, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">DTO</a> force developers to write useless boilerplate code.
Try to avoid these cumbersome tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Lombok</a> to create Java bean accessors methods and provide a builder to create instances.
Always consider using modern constructs such as <em>record</em> and <em>sealed class</em> to improve the legibility of your design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transform your objects with <a href="https://mapstruct.org/">MapStruct</a> library or similar ones.
Better minimize the usage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">data transfer objects</a> <em>DTO</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deploy as an executable application.
You do not need an application server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Package the whole application in a docker image for integration and testing activities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lightweight_database">Lightweight Database</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your services need to store persistent information in a database.
Spring framework promotes an SQL database and JPA as object mapper.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lightweight approach simplifies local development and speed-up the integration testing through your CI/CD pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our current approach is:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>use <a href="http://hsqldb.org/">HyperSQL</a> embedded database for local development and continuous integration pipeline.
No need to install database software and fast turnaround during development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isolate domain persistent data in separate databases or schemas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>control your persistent design using the Spring <em>schema.sql</em> and <em>data.sql</em> description files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use views for read-only complex models.
Always implement business logic in Java.
Prohibit integrity constraints between schemas to respect the principles of domain-driven design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use <a href="https://flywaydb.org/">Flyway</a> to update database schema and migrate persistent information into the new database schema.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use Spring mechanisms to load technical test data into the database before running automated integration tests.
Professional software development requires the creation and maintenance of a technical test database.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Define a schema per domain to isolate your domain model in the database.
Use the Spring files <em>schema.sql</em> to define a clean database model.
Do not define any integrity rules between schemas to insure modularity of your bounded domains down to the persistence layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JPA supports schemas through a standard annotation.</p>

<p>In the midst of the agile adoption explosion, many teams are experiencing difficulties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Organizations often mix agile with Scrum.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most common misconceptions about <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> is that it is synonymous with agile.
<a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> is an umbrella term that refers to a family of approaches that share common values and principles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrum is a commonly used agile framework that offers suggestions for how work can be organized to maximize value to the end-user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While Scrum is implemented at a product development team level, agile has a focus on the entire organization including its leadership and company culture.
Both are relatively easy to start down the path but difficult to master.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many organizations use Scrum in combination with other agile principles and practices.
Even if Scrum seems like a relatively easy framework to implement, there are changes needed on the individual and organizational level that scrum does not address.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teams often try hard to use new ways of working and learning.
The challenge is to explore the new approaches and not to fall back to traditional processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to the
<a href="https://stateofagile.com/">15th Annual State of Agile report</a>, 46% of survey respondents report struggles with inconsistent practices and 43% report cultural classes.</p>

<p>Below are some common symptoms of teams who are <em>pretending</em> to be agile:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Teams are not delivering a <em>done</em>, a usable increment at the end of each sprint.
By usable we mean that the product is fully tested and provides a fully usable increment of valuable functionality.
The product increment must be deployed on a server for internal or external use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The daily Scrum is a status update instead of a small planning session.
Reporting to attending managers is a clear sign of distrust and micromanagement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sprint review meeting is merely a demonstration, and not an opportunity for collaboration.
A clear sign of dysfunctional Scrum is when the content and the priority of backlog items is never updated during a sprint review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sprint retrospective does not result in actionable improvement ideas that the Scrum team addresses proactively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quality of the product resulting from the Scrum team’s work is not increasing
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Scrum master is not coaching the Scrum Team or the parent organization in techniques to improve the use of the Scrum framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers do not self-manage or collaborate with the Product Owner on ways to maximize the product’s value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The organization does not respect the Product Owner’s decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resource managers do not know how to support agile teams.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem is when a team begins to use an agile framework incorrectly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The team begins to focus more on their adherence to the process than they do to staying true to Agile values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is Dark Agile <a href="#detecting-agile-bullshit">[4]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The team presents itself as agile and believes it is practicing agile, but it is not.
It is practicing a framework without the support of agile values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can lead to micromanagement, a squashing of adaptability toward customers’ changing needs, and an extreme lessening of the benefits gained from Agile practice.</p>

<li>
<p>Visualize your initiatives and their metrics.
I want to see typical lean diagrams on the walls of your project space.
If your Scrum masters or product owners have only attended the initial two days training and never continued on the path, they are laymen.<br/>
You should work with professionals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check your culture.
Agile means you always trust all your collaborators.
Your ways of working emphasize transparency, inspection and adaptation.<br/>
Therefore, all information is available to all collaborators!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hire for cultural agile fit.

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">Immutability</a> is a powerful and simple concept in programming theory that is strangely underused.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">immutable object</a> is simply a class whose instances cannot be modified.
This is in contrast to a mutable object or changeable object, which can be modified after it is created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Immutable objects are also useful because they are inherently thread-safe.
Other benefits are that they are simpler to understand and reason about and offer higher security than mutable objects</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the information contained in each instance is provided when it is created and is fixed for the lifetime of the object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An example of immutable objects in Java is the <em>String</em> class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why are immutable objects so good?</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_advantages">Advantages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many reasons for sure, here are the three main ones:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Protection Against Programming Errors</dt>
<dd>
<p>We can send an immutable object to any class without worrying about it being altered by that class.
We never have to make a defensive copy.
The same applies when we get an instance for local storage in a cache.
We do not have to worry about whether the provider will hold on to a reference and change it later, invalidating our cache without our knowledge.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Increased Performance</dt>
<dd>
<p>We do not have to make defensive copies all the time.
This means that we save some work on the garbage collector which increases performance and decreases memory overhead.
We all want that, don’t we?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Thread Safety</dt>
<dd>
<p>After creation any number of threads can access immutable objects simultaneously, without any synchronization mechanism.
It is a huge advantage in the modern world of multicore processors.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_immutable_classes">Immutable Classes</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The class must be declared as <em>final</em>.
So those mutable child classes cannot be created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data members in the class must be declared as <em>private</em>.
Direct access to member variables is prohibited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data members in the class must be declared as <em>final</em>.
We cannot change the value of it after object creation.
Java requires that all final properties must be initialized in the constructor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No setters are provided to change the value of an instance variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A parameterized constructor should initialize all the fields performing a deep copy.
Data members cannot be modified through external object reference.
This is also called reference <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing_(computing)">aliasing</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, do not allow those objects to be changed:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not provide methods that modify the mutable objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not share references to the mutable objects.
Never store references to external, mutable objects passed to the constructor.
If necessary, create copies, and store references to the copies.
Similarly, create copies of your internal mutable objects when necessary to avoid returning the originals in your methods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java <em>record</em> construct <a href="#java-record">[1]</a> implements most of the above constraints.
The major limitation is that Java records do not perform any deep copies.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
Records provide secure serialization and deserialization mechanisms.
Use records as Java DTO objects and automatically improve the security of your application.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, Java records are shallow immutable objects.
If you pass immutable objects to the constructor, you will achieve deep immutability.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_immutable_api_classes">Immutable API Classes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java already has an extended and expanding set of immutable classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>All wrapper classes in <em>java.lang</em> package are immutable.
These are String, Character, Boolean, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The class java.awt.Rectangle encapsulates the position and dimension of a rectangle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>java.lang.StackTraceElement (used in building exception stack traces).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most enum classes are immutable, but this in fact depends on the concrete case.
Do not implement mutable enums, this will screw.
All enum classes are immutable in the standard API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>java.math.BigInteger and java.math.BigDecimal,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>java.io.File represents a file in a local or remote file system.
A file may or may not exist, and has some methods modifying and querying the state of this external object.
But the File object itself stays immutable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>java.util.Locale - representing a specific geographical, political, or cultural region,</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_builder_pattern">Builder Pattern</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Immutable abstractions have often verbose and cumbersome constructors.
You want to provide a more elegant approach to create instances of your immutable classes.
The builder pattern is ideal for creating immutable instances through legible and maintainable code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Writing builders is a tedious and repetitive activity.
Consider using the <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Lombok Project</a> to generate builders.
The lombok annotations <em>@Builder</em> and <em>@Superbuilder</em> are time savers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Provide factory methods to create often used immutable objects.
Use the builder in the body to write the creation code in one Java statement.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_read_only_interface_pattern">Read-only interface pattern</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Read-only interface pattern is an alternative to the Immutable object pattern.
It allows some objects to modify a value object while other objects can only fetch its values.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">Technical debt</a> or code debt is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework.
The rework is caused by choosing an easy limited solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer to realize.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another source of technical debt is natural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsolescence">technical obsolescence</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it accumulates <em>interest</em>, making it harder and harder to implement changes.
Unaddressed technical debt increases software entropy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spiraling out of control entropy is the death of countless software solutions over the last century.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly to monetary debt, technical debt is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes as e.g., a proof-of-concept is required to move projects forward.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some experts claim that the <em>technical debt</em> metaphor tends to minimize the ramifications, resulting in insufficient prioritization of the necessary work to correct it.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shipping first time code is like going into debt.
A little debt speed development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite…​</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid.
Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt.</p>

<h3 id="_how_to_measure_technical_debt">How to Measure Technical Debt</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here some approaches to quantify the technical debt of a product.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">New Bugs versus Closed Bugs</dt>
<dd>
<p>Every known bug is essentially a tiny sliver of technical debt.
If you want to know your total debt, it is important for your engineers to keep a tally.
Assuming your engineers make a note in git when bugs are fixed, you can calculate how effectively you are managing your technical debt.
If new bugs are outnumbering closed bugs, you need to make some changes.<br/>
<em>Zero bug policy <a href="#zero-defect">[1]</a> nicely reimburse this technical debt.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Code Quality</dt>
<dd>
<p>Complex code is a sure sign of growing technical debt.
At some point, someone is going to have to unravel that mess.
Code quality is an aggregation of several metrics that quantify the overall quality and complexity of your code:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Smells and potential errors detected through static analysis tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyclomatic complexity, method size, class size</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class and package coupling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depth of inheritance<br/>
<em>Continuous fitness functions [<a href="#building-evolutionary-architectures">1</a>] based on static code analyzers are the way to detect this technical debt cite:clean-code,clean-coder,clean-architecture].</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Cycle Time</dt>
<dd>
<p>This measures the amount of time that passes between the definition of the change, the first commit, and deployment.
You need to study the time it takes to make changes to existing code and to solve problems without using quick fixes.
If your engineers are spending hours fixing small bugs, you know that there is some technical debt lurking in your code.<br/>
<em>Your agile and Scrum tool provides cycle time data <a href="#metricsandkip">[metricsandkip]</a>.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Code Coverage</dt>
<dd>
<p>In a sense, the code coverage metric looks at the same issue from the opposite direction.
In this case, you are measuring how much of your code is executed when you run your testing suite.
The more lines that are unused, the more likely it is that you have poorly written code.<br/>
<em>Code coverage tools such as Jacoco provide these values <a href="#agilecode">[3]</a>.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Code Ownership</dt>
<dd>
<p>If you get too many people working on the same tasks, you can easily end up with a steaming pile of cruft.
That said, you do not want only one engineer taking ownership of an entire project.
If they get sick or leave your organization, it is game over.<br/>
<em>Social aspects can easily be measured in a code repository <a href="#codecrimescene">[2]</a>.</em></p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_to_continuously_improve">How to Continuously Improve</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A powerful approach is zero defect source code <a href="#zero-defect">[1]</a> approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can start very simply.
Track locations of technical debts with <em>TODO</em> and <em>FIXME</em> comments as a first step.
Next time you have to modify source code in a package use your IDE features to find all <em>TODO</em> in the package you are working on.
Fix at least one such comment and improve the code.
Repeat and over time, your technical debt will slowly diminish.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Investing a small amount for continuously improving your source code base is the most effective approach to avoid technical debt.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use an actual version of your technology stack.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">Do not scale agile…descale your organization</dt>
<dd>
<p>Henrik starts with this quote which directly conflicts with the 5% of people who claim to be scaling agile using Spotify.
It isn’t about changing agile to fit your company, it is changing your organization to achieve business agility.<br/>
<em>Have you considered descaling your organization before scaling agile?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Your Company is <strong>not</strong> Spotify</dt>
<dd>
<p>Spotify was born agile in 2006, so it is not even 20 years old.
And Spotify is small at roughly 1,500 people.<br/>
<em>Is your company new, do you have thousands of people and a rich history of success doing things a certain way?</em> <em>Do you have layers and layers of rules and bureaucracy for the right way to do things, as well as plenty of checks and balances?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Spotify was on a Mission</dt>
<dd>
<p>The stated Spotify mission is to turn the music business upside down.<br/>
<em>Does your company have a compelling purpose that aligns and motivates people?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Squad is equivalent to Scrum Team</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like Scrum teams, squads are cross-functional and self-organizing.
They are responsible for end-to-end delivery of a complete project.<br/>
<em>Are your “squads” self-organizing?</em> <em>Are they capable of end to end delivery or do you have hand-offs to other teams or departments?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Squads are Autonomous</dt>
<dd>
<p>Autonomy is the key to the company.
It includes not just what to work on next or how to complete their work.
Autonomy helps to scale because they don’t need as much central function.
Autonomy is fun and motivating.<br/>
<em>Are the squads you created autonomous?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Motivation is Essential for Productivity</dt>
<dd>
<p>Kniberg talks about how important employee motivation is to resolving the inevitable environmental issues.
Motivation has a higher impact on productivity than any other factor.
Kniberg has a simple formula showing that Productivity = Effort X Competence X Environment X Motivation^2.<br/>
<em>Is your company focused on increasing the motivation of each employee?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Balance alignment and autonomy</dt>
<dd>
<p>Spotify strives to strike a balance between alignment (central direction) and autonomy (team self-organization).
Managers paint the big picture but don’t tell people how to solve it.
This is probably one of the biggest sticking points for most organizations – managers are directly involved in telling people how to solve problems.<br/>
<em>Who makes decisions in your organization?</em> <em>What is the balance of power between team members and managers?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Shape the Environment</dt>
<dd>
<p>Physical space supports informal collaboration and coordination.
At Spotify, Squads sit and work together.
Tribes sit near each other and there are plenty of spaces for informal meetings without having to schedule a conference room.<br/>
<em>Has your company made an effort to co-locate people working together on the same team or tribe?</em> <em>Does your physical space support informal meetings without going to the trouble to schedule a conference room?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">No Magic in the terms Squads and Tribes</dt>
<dd>
<p>Henrik said he was not sure why they used weird words like Squads and Tribes.
The label itself means nothing.
Each tribe is a cross-functional team that is vertically aligned for delivery.<br/>
<em>Did you change your existing team to a squad without changing anything else?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Guilds are cross-cutting areas of Expertise</dt>
<dd>
<p>Guilds are the equivalent of Communities of Practice.
They are not functional departments, they are volunteer-led communities based around a particular expertise.<br/>
<em>Are your guilds communities based on expertise, or are they organized around key managers or existing functional departments?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Emphasis on face 2 face communications</dt>
<dd>
<p>That is the purpose of the structure of Tribes, Squads, and Guilds.
They were formed based on the need to coordinate and collaborate.
Tribes and Squads were organized so that they can sit together.<br/>
<em>Does your organization put a priority on face to face communications?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Boring Releases</dt>
<dd>
<p>Long release cycles are scary and risky.
Frequent releases are less scary, less risky and easy.
They become routine and boring.<br/>
<em>How often are you releasing to Production?
Are your releases scary or are they boring?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Decoupled Releases and CI/CD Reduces Cycle Time</dt>
<dd>
<p>Spotify focused on changing the architecture to decouple dependencies and make releases easier.
Dependencies are reduced and teams can release to production independent of each other.
Spotify has also invested heavily in continuous delivery to automate getting code to production in minutes, not days or weeks.<br/>
<em>On average, how long does it take to get from a changed line of code to that code live in production?
Do you measure and track this?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Trust and the Self-Service Model</dt>
<dd>
<p>Spotify empowers and trusts people so that where possible, teams make decisions that involve risks.
Kniberg uses the example of the difference in control between a roundabout and a typical traffic light.
Where possible, Spotify trusts people and does not try to control them because they believe that most people are doing what is best for the organization.<br/>
<em>What is the level of trust you place on your employees and teams?</em> <em>Are they empowered with opportunities for self-service, or are there checks and balances and delays due to waiting for approvals that slow them down?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Transparency &amp; short feedback loops</dt>
<dd>
<p>Transparency is one of the pillars of Scrum and essential for all agility.
Transparency is also an enabler for self-organization.
Similarly, short feedback loops provide opportunities for inspection and adaptation.
Fast feedback ensures teams are building the most valuable features.<br/>
<em>How long are your sprints?</em> <em>What is the time between when a team builds something and when a real customer uses or provides feedback on that feature?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Managers are Servant Leaders</dt>
<dd>
<p>Spotify believes that managers are servant leaders, focused on serving the highest needs of the team.
They think it is better for managers to ask teams how then can help, rather than asking people what they are working on or when they will be done.<br/>
<em>What is the posture of your managers to your teams?
Do they serve the teams, or do they think that the teams serve them?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Lean Startup</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Spotify mantra seems to be <em>Think it, Build it, Tweak it, Ship it</em> based on Eric Ries and the Lean Startup approach.
Teams establish a hypothesis and then run experiments and A/B tests and measure the results.
They strive to get lots of feedback, tweak what they implement and maximize the value.<br/>
They know the difference between maximizing value and not just output (i.e. more user stories completed).
<em>Are you set up to run small experiments?</em> <em>Or are your products/projects the result of a long list of requirements that are all built before deploying to production in a big bang?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Spotify Hack Week</dt>
<dd>
<p>Twice a year Spotify hosts a hack week when they let everyone work for a week on whatever they want.
The approach unleashes creativity and improves cross-organizational collaboration They celebrate with a party on Friday.<br/>
<em>How comfortable would your company be with a one-week hackathon that allows people to do whatever they want?</em> <em>What controls do you think your leaders would demand for that week (e.g. assigned work, time reporting, must show results, etc).</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Experiment-friendly Culture</dt>
<dd>
<p>More data-driven decisions, not decisions made by the highest paid person.
Teams are encouraged to develop a hypothesis and run an experiment.
Teams establish “Keep List” which may include things like: Retros, daily stand-ups, Google Drives, GIT, and Guild UnConferences.
They also have a “Dump List”: Time Reports, Hand-offs, Separate Test Teams or Test Phases, Task Estimates, Useless Meeting.<br/>
<em>Do you allow teams the freedom to really change how they work?</em> <em>Which on the dump list above do you require your teams to do and why?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Healthy Cultures Heals Broken Process</dt>
<dd>
<p>Process breaks left and right but a healthy culture will lead to people fixing those problems.<br/>
<em>How heavy is your process?</em> <em>Are teams allowed to change process or is the process dictated by a central Agile CoE or standards group?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Balance between Chaos and Bureaucracy</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like the balance between autonomy and alignment, Spotify is striking a balance between chaos and bureaucracy.
Of the two, Kniberg believes it is easier to fix chaos than bureaucracy.
Similar to Alistair Cockburn’s “barely sufficient” process guidance, Spotify came up with the concept of “minimum viable bureaucracy” or MVB.
It is the smallest amount of bureaucracy that an organization can have without chaos.<br/>
<em>What is the level of bureaucracy in your organization?</em> <em>Do your managers actively work to reduce or eliminate overhead so that teams can focus on being productive?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Team Definition of Awesome</dt>
<dd>
<p>Spotify encourages teams to talk about and decide what would make them awesome.
After all, without a vision for awesomeness, you likely won’t get there.
Spotify teams use regular team health checks.
They track improvements over time.<br/>
<em>Do your teams have a definition of awesome?
Do you track team health and strive for continuous improvement?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Culture Beats Process</dt>
<dd>
<p>As we have outlined in this post, the obvious and observable processes you have are not nearly as important as the culture which may be nearly invisible.
Culture is the behavior that is rewarded or what succeeds.
Culture cannot be delegated by managers and leaders.
Leaders need to model the behavior they want to see in an organization.<br/>
<em>What are the behaviors that are rewarded in your organization?
What are the behaviors that are modeled?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Employee Satisfaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>Kniberg tells the story of an email from the head of people operations about the results of a recent employee satisfaction survey.
The head claimed that 91% of employees enjoyed working at Spotify, which he said was “of course not satisfactory”.<br/>
<em>Do your leaders ask if people enjoy working at your company?</em> <em>What % satisfaction do you think your leadership and HR department consider acceptable?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Mistakes are OK</dt>
<dd>
<p>How mistakes are treated may be one of the best indicators of your culture.
Mistakes are expected when you are pushing for innovation.</p>

<p><a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle Build Tool</a> is my preferred build tool for all Java applications I am developing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Google chose Gradle as the official build tool for Android.
Not only because build scripts are code, but because Gradle is modeled in a way that is extensible in the most fundamental ways.
Gradle’s model also allows it to be used for native development with C/C++ and can be expanded to cover any ecosystem.
For example, Gradle is designed with embedding in mind using its Tooling API.</p>

<p>What are my preferred goodies with the major version 7?</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_java_module_native_support">Java Module Native Support</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java modules were introduced with Java 9 in September 2017.
Adoption was slow.
Developers needed time to understand the tremendous advantages of language and compiler support of modules.
Tooling was also a problem.
It was cumbersome and error-prone to create Java modules either using the command line and experimental plugins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle Build Tool</a> version 7 finally supports Java modules natively.
Just use the <em>java-library</em> plugin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The plugin will detect the presence of a <em>module-info.java</em> module declaration file and transparently switch to module compilation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_dependencies_semantic_declaration">Dependencies Semantic Declaration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Gradle team has decided to introduce semantic support for the declaration of dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All dependencies of a multi-module Java application are declared in a central file.
The <em>libs.versions.toml</em> file under the gradle subdirectory of the root build can contain all plugin and library dependencies.
The declarations can be used in all subprojects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Support is provided to group a set of related dependencies and use the alias in the various Gradle modules.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_intellij_support">IntelliJ Support</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jetbrains has improved support of Gradle in their new releases of IntelliJ.
The 2021 versions offer native support of Gradle.
Native support means IntelliJ finally uses Gradle for compilation and unit testing inside the IDE.
You just need to take care of one build configuration and no more need to delve in the mysteries of IntelliJ build process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only glitch is that IntelliJ has its own concept of modules and are not synchronized with the Gradle modules.
You have to be careful to align both structures to avoid surprises.</p>

<p>Using a goal-driven approach that guides people through process-related options is one powerful approach.
We need to take decisions to tailor and scale agile strategies to address the context of the situations we face.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://www.pmi.org">Project Management Institute</a> has acquired the disciplined agile delivery method and heavily promotes the approach.
I personally prefer the <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> approach to scale agile product development.
Nevertheless, Scott Ambler is an experienced and talented developer.
Learning from his experiences and analyzing his approaches promotes the essence of <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a>.
We want to experiment with new approaches and add the successful ones in our toolbox.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Supports process tailoring</strong>.
I think that figures below make it very clear how people are enabled to make intelligent process decisions.
I think that this is a huge improvement over previous process frameworks, particularly Rational Unified Process <em>RUP</em>.
<em>RUP</em> provides great process advice regardless of what some agilists may claim but struggled to provide consumable process tailoring advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enables effective scaling</strong>.  <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> is our preferred scaling approach.
An important part of scaling agile is to tailor your strategy to reflect the realities of the scaling factors which you face.
For example, consider your approach to exploring the initial scope of your effort (the goal captured in Figure 2).
A large agile team or a geographically distributed team will make different tailoring decisions than a small co-located team.
A team in a regulatory environment will make different decisions, particularly around amount of detail, than teams in non-regulatory environments.
These are just three of several scaling factors (more on this in a future blog posting, although you may find my agility at scale blog to be of interest).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Makes your process options very clea</strong>.
Figure 4, in combination with the more detailed goals diagrams (such as in Figures 2 and 3) make it very clear what you need to consider when tailoring an agile solution delivery process to meet the unique needs of the situation faced by your team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Takes the guesswork out of extending agile methods</strong>.
Although it makes for wonderful marketing rhetoric, it’s disingenuous for people to claim that simple methods such as Scrum can be tailored to meet your actual needs.
Yes, we suppose this claim is true but how do you do so?
Shouldn’t you start with a full delivery lifecycle, not just a construction lifecycle?
Shouldn’t the toolkit cover a wider range of issues, such as leadership and requirements management as Scrum does, technical issues as XP does, modeling and documentation as Agile Modeling does, and many other issues?
In short, shouldn’t it be a hybrid?
Finally, shouldn’t you be given some context-sensitive advice for tailoring the details, as we do with the goal-driven approach described here?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Makes it clear what risks you’re taking on</strong>.
By making your process decision options clear, and by describing the trade-offs associated with those options, we make it very clear what risks you’re taking on.
Want to write a detailed requirement specification up front then the approach is going to make it very clear what risks you’ve just taken on by doing so.
It also makes clear when this decision is appropriate, so if you’re not in this situation then it is likely time to rethink your approach.
Although we cannot prevent challenges such as a Water-Scrum-Fall approach.
Such when a heavy approach is taken to <em>Inception</em> and <em>Transition</em> and an agile approach to Construction.
We still can certainly make it very clear what the impact is of the decisions that led you to that approach.
We have spoken with several people who have used the decision tables in it to argue against inappropriate process decisions on their projects.
In many situations the argument <em>that isn’t agile</em> falls on deaf ears.
Whereas <em>that will take longer and here’s why</em>, <em>that will be more expensive and here’s why</em> will be listened to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It hints at an agile maturity model</strong>.
We suggest that in the case of issues where the options are ordered there is a clearly an indication of agile maturity or sophistication.
Having said that I have no desire to wade into the agile maturity model morass, but I think it is an important observation nonetheless.</p>

<p>I have noticed that a lot of applications are still on Java 8.
Java 8 was released in March 2014.
Businesses often say, we do not have time to invest now. <em>They are saying we prefer to accumulate technical debt</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Non-experts often estimate that it is a lot of work, maybe even weeks or months of work to upgrade from one LTS version to the next LTS version of Java.
It is seen as a challenge difficult to estimate, and is automatically postponed.
That is not a good approach.</p>

Actually, in the case of the weeks to months&#39; estimation, I often managed to migrate the application in a couple of days.

If you have the time available, I would recommend using the latest version of Java because you can use the new features and improvements.
It always increases developer productivity and application reliability

<p>If you do not have that time available to upgrade every six months, you might opt to using only the long term support versions.

<p>When we start developing against the new Java version, it’s recommended to start with your local machine, get that up and running first.
Then upgrade your build environment, so it supports the latest version of Java.
Get everything built and tested over there.
Then at the end, release it to the other environments, including the production environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When upgrading Java, you might upgrade from 8 to 17 at once.
If you have encountered any issues, it might be hard to pinpoint what’s caused the exact issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, it might be better to do the migration, step by step.
Maybe you migrate from 8 to 11 first, or maybe from 8 to 9.
If you encounter any issues, you can easily see what’s changed in that Java version.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Answers can often be found through Google or StackOverflow.
That way, it is easier to get the upgrades done instead of in one big bang.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, even after years of experience, I cannot estimate how long an upgrade will take without having in-depth information about the project.
A lot depends on how many dependencies your application has.
Often, upgrading your dependencies to the latest version resolves many of the issues that would occur during a Java upgrade.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do we move forward?
Now we start by compiling the source code on the new Java version, we run it.
If that succeeds, and we make the necessary fixes, we go to running the unit tests.
If we fix that as well, we can package the application, and in the end, we can run the application.
Based on the nice ingredients, we should get a nice result.</p>

<h4 id="_pattern_matching_for_switch">Pattern Matching for Switch</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A preview of pattern matching for switch extends the language of patterns in Java.
It allows switch expressions and statements to be tested against a number of patterns, each with a specific action.
This enables complex data-oriented queries to be expressed concisely and safely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among the goals of this feature include expanding the expressiveness and application of switch expressions and statements by enabling patterns to appear for labels, relaxing the historical null-hostility of switch when desired, and introducing two kinds of patterns: guarded patterns, which allow pattern matching logic to be refined with arbitrary Boolean expressions, and parenthesized patterns, which resolve some parsing ambiguities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In JDK 16 <a href="#jdk-16">[2]</a>, the <em>instanceof</em> operator was extended to take a type pattern and perform pattern matching.
The modest extension proposed allows the familiar instanceof-and-cast idiom to be simplified.
The implementation of the <em>boolean equals(Object o)</em> method is reduced to one expression without any conditional statement.
<em>Try the new implementation in your code</em>.</p>

<p>The line between software development and software architecture is a tricky one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some people will tell you that it does not exist and that architecture is simply an extension of the design process undertaken by developers.
Others will make out it is a massive gaping chasm that can only be crossed by lofty developers.
They believe you must always abstract your abstractions and not get bogged down by those pesky implementation details.</p>

<h3 id="_key_takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Understanding the basics of software architecture is more important than ever before, given the distributed nature of the software systems we are now building, and the distributed nature of the teams building them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sweet spot of up front design, between too much and none at all, should focus on understanding the significant decisions and trade-offs that influence the shape of a software system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good architects are active members of the development team, from collaborating on code to coaching and providing technical leadership to the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicating about software architecture is challenging.
The <a href="https://c4model.com/">C4</a> model can help structure the communication, starting with a context diagram, and working down to more technical aspects of the
system.</p>

<li>
<p>Contrary to some popular assumptions, putting effort towards good architecture actually enables agility.</p>

<p>The two big Scrum organizations <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/">Scrum Alliance</a> and <a href="https://www.scrum.org/">Scrum.org</a> provide a certification path for Scrum developers.
The certification path has three levels:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Certified Scrum Developer</dt>
<dd>
<p>Introduction course for those who are closest to the <em>realization</em> of the project.<br/>

</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Certified Advanced Scrum Developer</dt>
<dd>
<p>Advanced course for Scrum developers who already have one year of experience on a Scrum team.<br/>
<em>It is at least two days training.
You should read the recommended books to have a greater probability to pass the examination on the first try.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Certified Scrum Professional Scrum Developer</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pinnacle course for experts wishing to master the Scrum developer track.<br/>
<em>The third level requires more training, experience, and reading books.
You often must participate to workshops before being allowed to graduate.
Each certification organization has her own rules and conditions.</em><br/>
The goals are:<br/></p>

<p>Refactoring fosters automated testing, improves readability and maintainability; it can support improving system performance, counter technical debt, and improve extensibility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Test Driven Development (TDD)</em></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Test first focuses on the behavior of the system.
The system design emerges dynamically through the adjustment to additional tests.
Benefits include simplicity, avoidance of bloating, defect reduction, built-in regression checks with automated tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differences include frequency, inclusion in the development process, being tied to specification versus being tied to code, amount of automation, responsibility, timing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Point out that it is important to have the simplest possible solution that passes the test in the first place to ensure the test is working, and refactor it to a sensible design that can be verified immediately, refer to the Broken Window metaphor, foster collective stewardship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testers are Scrum team members, aka developers, include testing in the sizing discussion, collaborate on PBI refinement and acceptance criteria definition, pair up doing TDD
to embed good tests from the beginning, include considerations of load, exploratory, and other testing approaches, contribute to definition of done.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Integrating Continuously</em></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>CI is the practice of reducing the feedback time between code creation and integration.
It can be supported using technical means.
CI changes habits and behaviors, creates awareness about shared responsibility.
It is the base for frequent deliveries, reduces defects, reduces risk from late discovery of integration issues.</p>
<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i">
<li>
<p>Example 1: The increment is necessarily integrated.
Using CI is highly recommendable for getting to at least one increment per sprint or more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example 2: The daily Scrum can provide better transparency about the progress if there is a better measure for progress.
CI helps to get this transparency about what is working and what isn’t.
Without CI, the Scrum team might probably not know the actual status of the system for days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example 3: In the sprint review, only done PBIs are inspected.
CI improves the probability of having done PBIs at the end of the <a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#the-sprint">sprint</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automation tools reduce manual repetition, single repository acts as document of record, configuration as code for repeatable error-free process and support continuous delivery</p>

On the other hand, expedient anchoring of architecture practices in an agile approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The development of architectures in projects with self-sufficient teams or shared responsibilities demands new skills and capabilities on the part of developers and architects.

<p>Care was taken that all the above aspects are handled over the SWAT course.
The main difference is the SWAT course has a more technical approach to agile architecture.
Communication, team findings techniques and documentation are discussed in <a href="#chapter-4">Agile Approaches</a>, <a href="#chapter-10">Architecture Documentation</a> and <a href="#chapter-14">Excellence for Architects</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bachelor students have attended formal training in <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> and had extensive team workshop to foster communication techniques.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lessons_learnt">Lessons Learnt</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_foundations">Foundations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Principles need to be taught at the beginning.
The students already know concepts such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a> from previous lectures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They can seldom apply these principles in their own code or semester projects.
Understanding why certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">anti-patterns</a> are often wrong is seldom observable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can only become a professional software architect if you are proficient in a technology stack.
You shall be a craftsman about how to write industrial grade source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You know how to test it, deploy it, run it and maintain it.
You shall have knowledge of the idioms of your programming language and software design patterns at the component level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The students are motivated and eager to learn.
It takes time to establish the capabilities of a professional programmer and component designer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This time is missing in our SWAT lecture for the discussion of product software architecture themes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are now defining an overall path for all students to achieve craftsmanship over their bachelor curriculum.
Students must write professional source code, master design at the component level, and understand agile techniques.
Approaches such as clean code, test-driven development, refactoring and infrastructure as code shall be studied material.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_design_and_architecture">Design and Architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Design concepts must be refined.
The students understand concepts such as patterns, micro-architecture, layered architecture.
They seldom formulate the technical and financial tradeoffs associated with a specific concept application
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Almost no student has experience with open source libraries.
They use them on a daily basis and never looked at the source code, provided an improvement, or read the documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are trying to formulate an approach to improve achieved goals.
We shall either build these concepts into project management lectures or in the semester theses.</p>

<p>The static website build tool <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is awesome.
With the extensive built-in feature set of Hugo and the feature-rich text formatting options that <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a> offers, it creates a blogging experience composed of easy content management and fun writing experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most static site generators including Hugo, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> is the one and only first-class citizen when it comes to creating posts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, in recent Hugo versions, external helpers are an official feature.
It calls appropriate external programs to certain type of files.
Fortunately, Asciidoc based files are automatically compiled with <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a>, so we do not need to do anything.
Just have it installed and you are ready to go.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Hugo theme <a href="https://www.docsy.dev/">Docsy</a> is ideal to create a good-looking software documentation site.
This theme is currently the best match I found to combine product documentation with blogging.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I love to write my documentation and blogs using <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a> notation
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.
The official site is <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">AsciiDoc</a>.

<p>Hugo supports Asciidoctor through external helpers.

There is a proposal on improving it by adding user configurations so at least there is hope for this particular feature to expand.</p>

<p>The features of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc">AsciiDoc</a> set is equivalent to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook">DocBook</a>.
The readers with grey hair probably remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language">SGML</a>, the ancestor of DocBook.
The librarians could remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport">Leslie Lamport</a>.
He created it to describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic">temporal logic</a> aspects of cluster communication for the

The solution has no strings attached and uses the well-known platform GitHub.
No tracking, no ads and no locking are great.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer <em>siloed</em>.
Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle.
The work is from development through test, deployment to operations.
The range of skills is not limited to a single function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations.
When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as <em>DevSecOps</em>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These teams practice automating processes that historically have been manual and slow.
They use a technology stack and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably.
These tools also help engineers independently carry out tasks that normally would have required help from other teams.
This increases a team’s velocity.</p>

<h3 id="_benefits">Benefits</h3>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Speed</dt>
<dd>
<p>Move at high velocity, so you can innovate for customers faster, adapt to changing markets better, and grow more efficient at driving business results.
The DevOps model enables your developers and operations teams to achieve these results.
For example, microservices and continuous delivery let teams take ownership of services and then release updates to them quicker.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Rapid Delivery</dt>
<dd>
<p>Increase the frequency and pace of releases, so you can innovate and improve your product faster.
The quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the faster you can respond to your customers’ needs and build competitive advantage.
Continuous integration and continuous delivery are practices that automate the software release process, from build to deploy.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Reliability</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes, so you can reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience.
Use practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery to test that each change is functional and safe.
Monitoring and logging practices help you stay informed of performance in real-time.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Scale</dt>
<dd>
<p>Operate and manage your infrastructure and development processes at scale.
Automation and consistency help you manage complex or changing systems efficiently and with reduced risk.
For example, infrastructure as code helps you manage your development, testing and production environments in a repeatable and more efficient manner.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Improved Collaboration</dt>
<dd>
<p>Build more effective teams under a DevOps cultural model, which emphasizes values such as ownership and accountability.
Developers and operations teams collaborate closely, share many responsibilities, and combine their workflows.
This reduces handover inefficiencies and diminishes cycle-time.
It reduces for example handover periods between developers and operations, writing code that takes into account the environment in which it is run.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Security</dt>
<dd>
<p>Move quickly while retaining control and preserving compliance.
You can adopt a DevOps model without sacrificing security by using automated compliance policies.
For example, using infrastructure as code and policy as code, you can define and then track compliance at scale.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_devops_adoption">DevOps Adoption</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transitioning to DevOps requires a change in culture and mindset.
At its simplest, DevOps is about removing the barriers between two traditionally siloed teams, development and operations.
In some organizations, there may not even be separate development and operations teams; engineers may do both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With DevOps, the two teams work together to optimize both the productivity of developers and the reliability of operations.
They strive to communicate frequently, increase efficiencies, and improve the quality of services they provide to customers.
They take full ownership for their services, often beyond where their stated roles or titles have traditionally been scoped.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Quality assurance and security teams may also become tightly integrated with these teams.
Organizations using a DevOps model have teams that view the entire development and infrastructure lifecycle as part of their responsibilities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_devops_practices">DevOps Practices</h3>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous Integration</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Continuous integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository.
Automated builds and tests are run upon changes in the repository.
The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate software updates.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">Continuous Delivery</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production.
It expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment or a production environment after the build stage.
When continuous delivery is implemented properly, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Modular Systems and Microservices</dt>
<dd>
<p>The microservice’s architecture is a design approach to build a single application as a set of small services.
Each service runs in its own process and communicates with other services through a well-defined interface using a lightweight mechanism.
Microservices are built around business capabilities; each service is scoped to a single purpose.
You can use different frameworks or programming languages to write microservices and deploy them independently, as a single service, or as a group of services.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">Infrastructure as Code</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Infrastructure as code is a practice in which infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code and software development techniques.
Examples are version control and continuous integration.
The cloud’s API-driven model enables developers and system administrators to interact with infrastructure programmatically.
They do need to interact manually set up and configure resources.
Engineers can interface with infrastructure using code-based tools and treat infrastructure in a manner similar to how they treat application code.
Because they are defined by code, infrastructure and servers can quickly be deployed using standardized patterns, updated with the latest patches and versions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Monitoring and Logging</dt>
<dd>
<p>Organizations monitor metrics and logs to see how application and infrastructure performance impacts the experience of their product’s end user.
By capturing, categorizing, and then analyzing data and logs generated by applications and infrastructure, organizations understand how changes or updates impact users, shedding insights into the root causes of problems or unexpected changes.
Active monitoring becomes increasingly important as services must be available 24/7 and as application and infrastructure update frequency increases.
Creating alerts or performing real-time analysis of this data also helps organizations more proactively monitor their services.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Communication and Collaboration</dt>
<dd>
<p>Increased communication and collaboration in an organization is one of the key cultural aspects of DevOps.
The use of DevOps tooling and automation of the software delivery process establishes collaboration by physically bringing together the workflows and responsibilities of development and operations.
Building on top of that, these teams set strong cultural norms around information sharing and facilitating communication through the use of chat applications, issue or project tracking systems, and wikis.
This helps speed up communication across developers, operations, and even other teams like marketing or sales, allowing all parts of the organization to align more closely on goals and projects.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_java_devops">What is Java DevOps?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java DevOps is simply applying DevOps practices and philosophies to Java app development.
That means that compartmentalized teams are no longer needed when creating Java applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should understand these principles:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous integration</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This practice requires developers to periodically merge the code that they have written into a central repository.
After the merge, tests and automated builds are executed.
This allows a team to find issues and quickly quash out bugs, improve the application’s quality and then cut the time needed to validate your apps.
Often the step of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">Continuous Delivery</a> is added to the pipeline.<br/>
<em>Use a platform such as gitLab, gitHub, BitBucket, or Azure DevOps.
Use Gradle as your build tool.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment">Continuous delivery</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This practice requires your team to release into production all code changes after it is written and then automatically built, and tested.
If continuous integration puts your code changes onto a testing environment, continuous delivery puts it into a production environment.
What does this mean?
You will always have a production-ready Java application!<br/>
<em>Use Gradle to create your application.
Use Docker, Ansible to deploy.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">Microservices</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>DevOps make use of microservices.
Instead of having one big monolithic Java application, your application is made up of smaller and independent applications.<br/>
<em>Use domain driven design DDD as your architecture method.
Prefer standalone applications embedding your application server.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">Infrastructure as a code</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This practice means that infrastructure is allocated and then managed by using code and development techniques.
Cloud services can help your development and operations teams interact with infrastructure at a scale they are comfortable with.
With infrastructure as a code, servers and infrastructure are deployed fast, automatically patched and can easily be duplicated.<br/>
<em>Use Docker and Ansible to automate your deployment.</em></p>

<h3 id="_lessons_learnt">Lessons Learnt</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The motivations for what has become modern <em>DevOps</em> and several standard DevOps practices such as automated build and test, continuous integration, and continuous delivery originated in the Agile world, which dates to the 1990s.
Agile development teams using methods such as <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> could not <em>satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software</em> unless they subsumed the operations responsibilities associated with their applications, many of which they automated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> emerged as the dominant Agile framework in the early 2000s, and it omitted the engineering practices that were part of many Agile teams, the movement to automate operations functions splintered from Agile and expanded into what has become modern DevOps.[11] Today, DevOps focuses on the deployment of developed software, whether it is developed via Agile or other methodologies</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To practice DevOps effectively, software applications have to meet a set of architecturally significant requirements such as: deployability, modifiability, testability, and monitorability.
You must continuously monitor your infrastructure, network and application.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock caution">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need a cultural change to implement successfully DevOps workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bigger companies often have trouble with the changes.
Command and control cultures always fail.
It boils down if your culture trusts your collaborators - often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_Theory_Y">Theory X and Theory Y</a> beliefs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interestingly, the DevOps transformation is similar to an agile transformation.
The approaches, recipes and failures are similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Smaller organizations are often more affine with trust.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although it is possible to practice DevOps with any architectural style, the microservices architectural style is becoming the standard for building continuously deployed systems.
Small size service allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring,[69] hence reducing the need for a big upfront design, allows for releasing the software early[citation needed] and continuously.</p>

There are several references to self-management in the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/">Scrum Guide</a> as in the current version of 2020.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Scrum Teams</em> are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Sprint Planning: How will the chosen work get done?</em> How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers.
No one else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.
This creates focus and improves self-management.</p>
</div>

<p>The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use various indicators to detect the self-management requirement at the Scrum team level is no more than lip service:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You assign specific tasks directly to Developers, thus bypassing the Product Owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, you remove a Developer from the Scrum team (temporarily) to work on such a task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers are assigned to support other organization members while ignoring their commitment to achieving the Sprint Goal.
Examples are supporting sales in a pitch, or being an expert in management meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scrum is rolled back in a moment of crisis to a traditional form of command &amp; control, exercised, for example, by dispatching jobs directly to individual Developers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ignoring self-management does not only violate Scrum’s first principles.
It also indicates that a manager cannot let go of command and control practices.
They continue to micromanage subordinates, although a Scrum team could accomplish the task themselves.
This behavior demonstrates a level of ignorance that may require support from a higher management level to address.</p>

<p>A technical lead is responsible for helping their team members with the technical aspects of their jobs, such as coding and programming.
They may also explain new projects to their team and troubleshoot any problems that occur.
In comparison, an engineering manager is more focused on managing their employees.
They are responsible for business growth and team deadlines, and they typically serve as their team’s representative to the rest of the company.</p>

<p>Architecture principles hold true in agile environments.
The major difference between older traditional approaches and modern agile ones is the way of performing enterprise architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last years have shown a promising evolution of plan-based, centralist enterprise architecture approaches to more agile, decentralized, meritocracy driven processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These new approaches are way more compatible with modern and agile software product development framework such as <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a>, <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a>, and <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Traditional processes use dedicated persons or departments to define architecture principles in a top-down approach.
Thick standards such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Architecture_Body_of_Knowledge">Enterprise Architecture Body of Knowledge</a> codifies wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Guide to the Enterprise Architecture Body of Knowledge (EABOK) organizes and characterizes the knowledge content of the Enterprise Architecture (EA) discipline.
This organization and characterization promotes a consistent view of EA, establishes the scope and bounds of the EA discipline, and places the discipline in the context of related disciplines.
The EABOK subdivides EA into knowledge areas and topics within each area, presents an overview of the topic, and provides the reader references for further information.
The EABOK is a guide to EA, not the body of knowledge itself.</p>

<p>The enterprise architects community has realized over the years that the centralist approach is too slow and cumbersome for the digital age.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group">Open Group</a> promotes the official enterprise architecture method
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework">TOGAF</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Open Group published a series of white papers <a href="#agile-architecture">[1]</a>, <a href="#open-agile-architecture">[2]</a> to bridge the gap between classical enterprise architecture and agile digital product development.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_architecture">Enterprise Architecture</a> <em>EA</em> , when performed in an agile manner, is an important enabler of agile software delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is true for several reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Common architecture enables agile teams to focus on value creation</dt>
<dd>
<p>A common enterprise architecture enables reuse across delivery teams.
When agile teams have high-quality assets – such as micro-services, legacy data sources, and frameworks – they are able to focus on creating new value.
They should not waste money on reinventing new versions of existing infrastructure.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Common technical guidance enables greater consistency</dt>
<dd>
<p>When team follow effective, common conventions it results in greater quality.
This makes it easier to learn about assets that are new to them, in particular existing source code, and to evolve those assets as needed.
Greater consistency also makes it easier for people to move between teams.
It will be easier for them to come up to speed on what the new team is doing and to share their skills with those team members.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Agile architectures enable disaggregation</dt>
<dd>
<p>When your solutions are built from loosely coupled, highly cohesive components it is easier to spread development work across smaller teams.
This reduces overall risk and organizational complexity, which in turn reduces time-to-delivery.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Common infrastructure enables continuous delivery</dt>
<dd>
<p>A common technical infrastructure empowers delivery teams to deploy into it.
The easier it is to deploy, the more often it makes sense to deploy.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Enterprise architecture scales agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>An agile approach to enterprise architecture enables organizations to scale agile strategies “horizontally” across their entire IT department.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_ea_process">The EA Process</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some methods will choose to prescribe a single approach.
Such as capturing architectural requirements in the form of epics or pre-building <em>architectural runways</em>.
The agile toolkit promotes an adaptive, context-sensitive strategy.
A goal-driven approach that indicates the process decision points you need to consider.
Have a range of techniques or strategies for you to address each decision point, and the advantages and disadvantages of each technique.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following diagram overviews the potential activities associated with <em>Agile Enterprise Architecture</em>.
image::2021-07-02-entreprise-architecture-process.png[width=800,height=800,role=center]
The process decision points that you need to consider for enterprise architecture are:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Support stakeholders</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enterprise architects will work with business and IT stakeholders on a regular basis to understand their needs and to help them develop a vision for the organization.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Support delivery teams</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enterprise architects will work with IT delivery teams, and ideally be active members of IT delivery teams, on a regular basis.
They may guide the teams in the business and technical roadmaps, help them to identify potentially reusable assets, to identify technical debt.
They should transfer their skills and knowledge to team members.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Negotiate technical dependencies</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like it or not, there are dependencies between the solutions that we create.
For example, if your system invokes a web service, or calls an API, provided by another system then you have a dependency on that system.
Enterprise architects will often find that they need to negotiate these dependencies with other teams, either at a high-level in their role of Enterprise Architect or sometimes at a detailed level in their role of Architecture Owner on a delivery team.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Explore architectural views</dt>
<dd>
<p>Organizations are complex and as a result they must be understood from a variety of view points.
It’s not just a matter of writing “architectural epics” on a collection of index cards.
The enterprise architecture team may choose to adopt, and likely tailor, an existing enterprise architecture framework.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Tailor the chosen architecture framework</dt>
<dd>
<p>These frameworks typically suggest a multi-view collection of artifacts to create and techniques for doing so.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Evolve enterprise architecture</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enterprise architects will collaborate with one another, and with their stakeholders, in a variety of ways.
They may choose to hold architecture envisioning/modeling sessions or regular meetings where they share learnings with one another.
They will often work together, or with IT delivery teams, to investigate new technologies or identify candidate architecture strategies.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Evolve roadmap(s)</dt>
<dd>
<p>An important output of your enterprise architecture effort will be one or more roadmaps.
They describe your technology strategies and your architectural strategies.
The roadmaps are updated in a rolling wave approach where the roadmap(s) are updated regularly.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Capture enterprise architecture</dt>
<dd>
<p>There are two broad categories for how enterprise architects can capture their work: as documents or as working/executable examples.
High-level models work well for the documentation.
Executable artifacts, such as executable reference architectures or architectural runways, are usually preferred over documentation by delivery teams.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Govern architecture</dt>
<dd>
<p>Architectural activities within your organization should be governed in a lightweight, collaborative manner.
This is an important activity for enterprise architects as well as for your IT governance team.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_team_workflow">Team Workflow</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The workflow within an agile enterprise architecture team is depicted in the following diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock center">
<div class="content">
<img src="../pics/2021-07-02-team-workflow.jpg" alt="2021 07 02 team workflow" width="800" height="400"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are four major activities:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Envision initial architecture</dt>
<dd>
<p>The enterprise architects will spend several days developing initial, high-level models of the enterprise architecture.
This will be a face-to-face, initial architecture envisioning session where the scope is the entire organization, not just a single IT solution.
Ideally this is done in an agile modelling room to streamline the communication and collaborative modelling efforts.
Such a room is large with lots of whiteboard space, enabling the team to work on several models in parallel (each of which has its own section of wall space).
The primary purpose of this session is for the EA team to develop a common understanding, at least a high level, of the current state of the enterprise architecture and a vision for how the team would like to see it evolve.
Secondary outcomes include creating some initial artifacts.
The enterprise architects will evolve these artifacts over time, meeting one another for the first time, and building bonds between the team members.
Potential challenges to this activity include getting an agile modeling room, and the logistics of getting the right people together at the same time.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Collaborate with business stakeholders</dt>
<dd>
<p>On a regular basis enterprise architects work with business stakeholders to understand their needs.
They work with them to envision the future, and help educate them on the possibilities and constraints of technology.
This collaboration may be in the form of working sessions, presentations, or one-on-one conversations.
These sessions occur as needed and at times it can be difficult to gain access to stakeholders as they are often very busy people.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Collaborate with IT stakeholders</dt>
<dd>
<p>Disciplined agile EAs will spend the majority of their time, 80 to 90% of it typically, working as members of IT delivery teams.
By doing this they bring their knowledge, vision, and skills to the team in a pragmatic, hands-on manner.
The teams will often take on the role of <em>architecture owners</em>.
Enterprise architects will also work with other IT stakeholders, including operations engineers, support staff, the data management team.
They need to understand their needs.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Evolve architecture assets</dt>
<dd>
<p>The enterprise architecture team, or at least the portion of the team who is currently available, will meet on a regular basis.
They evolve the enterprise architecture assets based on their learnings.
A common pattern we have seen it for the team to meet every Friday afternoon for two hours.
They discuss what they’ve learned that week from working on delivery teams and working with their various stakeholders.
The result of the meeting is often that the enterprise architects may take on action items to update existing artifacts.
These artifacts may include EA models, reference architectures, development guidelines, white papers.
When a new major topic arises, such as the potential adoption of a new platform or a merger with another organization, they schedule agile modelling sessions.
They explore the newly discovered topics during these sessions.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Various organizations are trying to redefine enteprise architecture in the context of agile approaches.
Such an example would be the <em>Agile Enterprise Architecture Framework</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often you see the tension between more agility and the drag of traditional complex enterprise architecture frameworks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The regular enterprise architecture frameworks are too complicated to be applied in nimble product development.
The approach is cumbersome and slow.
The processes are based on the assumption documents are written and later a group of experts review them.
Agile approaches are too nimble and fast to mesh with such workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The techniques used in these frameworks are powerful ones.
Software designers should master and use them accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I strongly prefer the architecture work techniques described in <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a>.
The <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> framework uses good practices to improve architecture and design.
Their approach is highly compatible with agile practices and speed of development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I do not use the bloated TOGAF architecture standard.
I also avoid bloated agile methodologies such as <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I recommend using all these proven architecture techniques and tools.
Apply them on your software product development using agile approaches like <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> and <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Congratulations, working as a professional <a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-owner">product owner</a> is a fulfilling and exciting job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should attend professional training.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being a product owner and requirements engineer is a profession, not a hobby!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Formal training is often the difference between being a professional instead of just pretending to be one.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_product_owner_role">Product Owner Role</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here the official definition of the product owner role taken from the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/">Scrum Guide</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Product Owner</strong> is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.
How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-owner">Product Owner</a> is also accountable for effective <strong>Product Backlog</strong> management, which includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developing and explicitly communicating the <strong>Product Goal</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating and clearly communicating <strong>Product Backlog</strong> items;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ordering <strong>Product Backlog Items</strong>; and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that the <strong>Product Backlog</strong> is transparent, visible and understood.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others.
Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions.
These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the <strong>Product Backlog</strong>, and through the inspectable <strong>Increment</strong> at the <strong>Sprint Review</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.
The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the <strong>Product Backlog</strong>.
Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>How can you become a better product owner?
The first steps to become a great product owner are described in this article.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agile approaches advocate dynamic planning and adaptation to new inputs and priority changes.
The <a href="http://bbrt.org/">Beyond Budgeting Round Table</a> movement promotes rolling planning, budgeting and reporting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>beyond budgeting</em> techniques recommend the complete abolition of traditional budgeting processes.
They require the implementation of new techniques that will replace them.
The BB framework does not specify the exact techniques that are applicable to all companies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, there are some techniques that have proven to be effective in real cases in the past.
These techniques include the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rolling forecasts are created monthly or quarterly rather than on an annual interval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Company’s targets are based on key performance indicators <em>KPI</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The performance of the company’s managers is evaluated based on external benchmarks rather than their past performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operational managers are empowered to react to the changes in the business environment and can dynamically coordinate their actions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What are the consequences of rolling approaches to any CRM or ERP system?</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_accounting">Accounting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rolling accounting is quite easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You shall display only transactions bocked during the selected time interval.
You shall be able to generate the balance sheet for the date defining the start of the time interval.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The data are usable only if your accounting department does not tune the accounts at the end of the quarter or at the end of the year.
For example, Swiss companies shall separate the rolling accounting from their legal accounting used for VAT or earnings tax purposes.
A better approach is to define rules avoiding most of the tuning actions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_customers_activities_and_offers">Customers, Activities and Offers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No special effort is necessary.
Customer relationship activities just need to be timely registered.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_contracts_and_projects">Contracts and Projects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only the contracts and projects active in the selected time interval shall be displayed.
Efforts booked during the time interval are relevant for the analytics.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_invoices">Invoices</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The invoices sent to the customers or the effectively paid invoices during the selected item interval shall be considered and displayed.
These invoices are relevant for the computation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow">cash flow</a> and the financial success of the associated projects
and contracts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_implementation">Implementation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tangly ERP was extended to support rolling analytics based on a user-defined time interval.
The system shall have all raw data available for the chosen time interval.
The approach is similar to an event store.
Designs based on a yearly reporting structure make the concept of rolling time periods almost impossible to realize.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system supports the definition of a time interval to display only currently relevant entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The analytics time interval is independent of the system overall interval.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lessons_learnt">Lessons Learnt</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture">Event sourcing</a> concepts are very powerful to implement an ERP providing time-interval based visualization and analysis.
The concept works well with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">Domain Driven Design</a> concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The responsiveness of the application is impressive for data volume compatible with small and medium enterprises.
We do not have empirical data for international companies.
The approach works well if all data are based on true and fair booking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Legal aspects in countries like Switzerland often imply that accounting reflects tax view instead of a true and fair view of the finances.
Such systems are not compatible with the beyond budget concepts and will display skewed information.
The whole financial system must be true and fair to enable rolling planning and reporting.</p>

<h3 id="_main_success_factors">Main Success Factors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main success factors for an agile transformation are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Soft skills such as transparency, collaboration, and trust.
<em>These values are part of the <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> and of <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> approaches.</em></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The agile approach continues to spread rapidly around the world: 89.8% of all teams have already adopted or are in the process of adopting agile methodology, a considerable number.
On the other hand, organizations are still struggling to build greater company-wide agility.
Only a few have already adopted agility on a portfolio level (15.3%) or strategic level (8.2%).
The good news is that many companies have started transformation initiatives or are planning to do so in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="_findings">Findings</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The major finding of the agile community during 2020 and 2021 is co-location is not mandatory for a successful agile approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remote working and distributed teams can work very successfully on a product.
You need high-quality tools such as videoconferencing, chat, collaborative tools and pair working approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The huge gain of 2020 and 2021 was the tremendous improvements of these tools due to the Corona lockdown.
Companies still need to invest in high-quality headsets, cameras and 4K displays for their collaborators.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not be penny wise and pound foolish.
Invest in professional hardware and buy the adequate number of licenses.
I always wonder why companies implement communication infrastructure with the free version of Slack or GitHub.</p>

<p>Agile approaches are steadily making progress in Switzerland.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>During an agile, the organization needs to be changed.
You are involved and probably have no ‘official’ authority to affect the needed changes.
This is a good thing!
It requires you to convince people to change because they believe it is the Right Thing to do.
But influencing change in organizations is far from trivial.
Frequently, no matter how hard you have tried, it changes in the opposite direction.
The question then becomes, how do you survive?
Staying alive and sane in organizations requires:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Patience and low expectations</dt>
<dd>
<p>Most organizations change slowly.
You should better set your expectations low (not your goal!), and remind yourself that you will be working on this for years.
Do celebrate small changes.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Persistence</dt>
<dd>
<p>Do not expect your change suggestions to be adopted immediately but do expect to explain them a gazillion times (often to the same people).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Courage</dt>
<dd>
<p>Nothing will change without courage.
Do not be afraid to speak up to higher management or make proposals that are way out of your comfort zone.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Sense of humor</dt>
<dd>
<p>You have worked for a year to convince people to change something.
They did, and they made it worse.
What do you do?
Take it seriously and do not take it seriously.
Laugh.
It is the only way to survive.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Open and humble</dt>
<dd>
<p>You must courageously, persistently, and patiently propose change.
Laugh it off when stupid decisions ruin your work.
All of this must be done in an open and humble way, as otherwise there is no new learning for you.
Maybe you are wrong and they were right?</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Did we mention <em>patience</em>?
I wish a fruitful and successful transformation to better way of working and of creating awesome products.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">When Introducing Agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>One of the biggest factors affecting team fluency is an organizational support.
To continue the bus metaphor, the team has to ride the bus to their fluency zone.
No one can do it for them.
The organization has to buy the bus tickets.
An organization that expects fluency without providing appropriate support is bound to be disappointed.
Even worse, insufficient support can cause turnover and create a cynical corporate culture that hinders improvements.
Before embarking on your fluency journey, be sure your organization is prepared to offer the support the journey needs.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">When Sustaining Agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is rare for stable teams to lose fluency on their own.
In our experience, external disruptions cause fluency loss.
The most common cause of fluency loss is when new management decides that agile approaches do not fit their vision.
Without organizational support and the ability to continue practicing what they have learned, team fluency erodes quickly.
This is often accompanied by loss of expertise as dissatisfied team members seek new positions.
Turnover is a related cause of fluency loss.
A team that gains or loses too many members may have trouble sustaining what it is learned.
This is a particular problem for organizations that assemble new teams for every project.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Agile Fluency and Scrum</dt>
<dd>
<p>Agile and Scrum requires long-living and stable teams.
A team should work over years on one product development and improvements.
Agile at organizational level can only work if the upper and middle management transitioned to agile thinking and handling.
The <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> community is vocal how destructive wrong management decision can be.
Agile development is a team sport, so fluency is a trait of the team, not individual team members.
Fluency is more a matter of habits than skills.
Discipline is king.</p>

<p>As a modern leader, you are aware of the importance of transforming your organization to become more agile.

The leadership behaviour of your colleagues is only changing slowly.

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_where_we_stand">Where We Stand</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The agile approach continues to spread rapidly around the world.
A stunning <strong>89.8%</strong> of all teams have already adopted or are in the process of adopting an agile methodology.
It is an impressive and considerable number.
It also shows when you look at the number of people who have a Scrum Master certification.
Around a million of them are Certified Scrum Master.
Quite a smaller number of people are Certified Product Owners.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, organizations are still struggling to build greater company-wide agility.
Only a few have already adopted agility on their product portfolio (15.3%) or on the strategic level (8.2%).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The good news is that many companies have started whole transformation initiatives or are planning to do so in the near future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating products with agile approaches is now mainstream.
Only laggards are clutching on obsolete methods.
Competitive advantage is now to implement an agile product value stream through the whole organization.
Fast delivery to customers and pivot to disruptive changes are the new key for extraordinary growth and success.
The raise of digital and Internet affine banking solutions is such a transformative example.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_waterfall_vs_agile">Waterfall vs Agile</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The collected data clearly show agile approaches are tremendously more successful by more than 10%.
The agile approach seems to eliminate catastrophic development failures.
It means an agile team has 25% higher relative probability to be victorious than classical teams (<em>50.5% versus 39.5%</em>).</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_transformation_drivers">Transformation Drivers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IT department is still the main driver for agile transformation.
Going fully agile is challenging and sticking with waterfall is no more an option.
Leaving many companies stuck in a hybrid approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Swiss companies are often embracing Hermes
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> or <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a>.
Both approaches are quite a poor choice to achieve a successful agile transformation.
Read the technology radar of <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com">Thoughworks</a> for a detailed discussion why SAFe is a poor choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Satisfaction with the agile way of working is high; satisfaction with the transformation process is low.
The focus is still processes over people.
The JIRA tool is omnipresent and workflows are documented in acribic details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This has left many, about 40% to be exact, stuck in a hybrid approach, i.e., a combination of waterfall and agile.
This is not necessarily a catastrophic thing if you manage to get the best of both worlds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kanban offers an easy start with agile and unlike Scrum is applicable to any process.
As our numbers show, it is becoming more and more popular.
Remember, it is not Kanban if it doesn’t have WIP limits.</p>

<p>There is also a trend towards stable product teams that extend their responsibilities beyond those of <em>just</em> the development of a solution or service.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agile transformation has stalled during the second wave in many companies.
Only individual elements of the third wave, such as portfolio management, have been tackled.
At the same time, transformation has often only occurred on the surface; the company’s DNA and culture have not (yet) adapted to the new era.
Executives must now take on the hard topics, such as new organizational forms, management behaviour, dedicated agile executives.
They must make difficult and painful decisions regarding new leadership teams.</p>

<p>Agile approaches are steadily making progress in Switzerland.
We have reached the level where late majority and laggards are slowly looking at the approach.
Low-hanging fruits were collected.
The next gains require deeper changes.
Progress is slow and resistance is very high.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Collaborators are happy with the change and do not want to go back to the old world.
However, the change often does not go beyond a first application of the methodology.
The biggest obstacle for employees is at the same time the biggest challenge for leaders.
A culture that promotes a learning and adaptable organization and its own agile way through the organization.</p>

<p>I am currently focusing on Software Craftsmanship and key agile values and approaches.
The more people know about key principles, the better the adoption and the implementation will be.
One decision was to teach and train bachelor students of technical universities in these principles to implement a grassroot approach.
The hope is to foster a deeper adoption of agile key values and related practices.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lately, I was asked which new approaches should be used for agile requirements engineering.
Did we find a new silver bullet to write software specifications the agile way?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The answer is an easy one.
We do not need new approaches or complicated processes.
Start with proven principles and learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.impactmapping.org/">Impact Mapping</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">Story Mapping</a>
are successful approaches to identify and prioritize your functions.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example">Specification by Example</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">User Stories</a>
as a discussion allow you to refine your understanding of what your customers need.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing">Acceptance Testing</a> verifies the implementation fulfills the expected behavior.
You get the mechanism to avoid regression problems when releasing your application for free.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The associated theory was published in seminal books more than a <strong>decade</strong> ago.
Just start applying the principles.
You can later still improve your approach based on your learnings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A nice overview was published in the <em>Professional Product Owner</em> [<a href="#professional-product-owner">1</a>] written by the stewards of the product owner certification path of <a href="https://www.scrum.org">Scrum.org</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_approach">Approach</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_specification">Specification</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use Impact mapping and story mapping to classify and order your functionality.
Story mapping works hand in hand with the release plan artifact I cited in a previous post.
You have not only the key functionality you want to deliver, but also a tentative plan when you will deliver them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vision, roadmap, and release plan are needed artefacts for any product development using Scrum as a development approach.
The mapping identifies the stories to realize in a release to satisfy the customer’s needs.
A nice discussion of these concepts can be found in <em>Strategize</em> [<a href="#strategize">2</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The nice think is that impact mapping and story mapping are quite compatible with design thinking.
We can nicely connect the different directions used in agile product development and marketing departments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each specification story has acceptance criteria.
These criteria are the specifications of your product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum community clearly states that product backlog items are not specifications.
They are work items for the Scrum team.
If you want to use stories to describe your needs instead of the specification by example approach, it is OK, but please not in the backlog.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_validation">Validation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Acceptance criteria is a form of specification by example.
Acceptance tests - see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_test%E2%80%93driven_development">ATDD</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a> - are the automatic check for specification by example.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock left">
<div class="content">
<img src="../pics/2021-04-03-test-pyramid.png" alt="2021 04 03 test pyramid" width="420" height="360"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The gain of implementing the acceptance criteria as ATDD is guaranteed elimination of regression issues.
You also get automatic generation of test plans, test results and requirement documents.
Your documents are always in sync with the source code of your product.
An additional advantage is all these artifacts are under source code management and fully auditable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had success with <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/fitness-function-driven-development">Fitness Functions</a>
to describe and validate non-functional requirements.
We recommend taking this approach.
You can extend your automatic validation to non-functional requirements with the same mechanisms as for functional requirements.</p>

<p>Event Storming is a collaborative analysis practice that brings together domain experts and developers for a common understanding of the needs to be realized.
Conducted in the form of a workshop, its purpose is to quickly discover what is happening in the software domain.
Compared to other methods, it is extremely light and intentionally does not require any computer support.
The result is expressed in sticky notes on a wall.</p>

<p>Often, I hear complain that the IT department is not reacting to developer’s needs.
They are slow, clumsy and too administrative.
Harsher words state they are incompetent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have observed a clear trend in Switzerland since around 2015 to solve these tensions.
Standard IT services such as docker images, database instances or internal domain names are provided through self-service kiosks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What are the advantages of this approach?</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_advantages">Advantages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advantages to providing a self-service kiosk for users in an academical or industrial environment are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improving data quality and strongly reducing the error rate.
Kiosk services must be standardized before being offered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving response time and access to resources outside regular office hours without additional human resources,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saving of costs,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relieving the personnel of the IT department of repetitive and mundane tasks,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased capacity for working on strategic tasks,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Involvement of employees in human resource management processes.
The kiosk solution must be connected to the on-boarding and off-boarding processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased personal responsibility and independence of employees,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparency and traceability of the approval channels,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to the system independent of time and place,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribution to employer branding,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduction of printing costs as processes are handled digitally.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar gains are achievable for employees working for smaller or bigger commercial companies.
The real gains are less animosity and more respect for the IT professionals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_challenges">Challenges</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The provided self-service products shall cover at least 80% of customer’s needs.
The products must be standardized and do not require manual actions for setup and deployment.
This quality of service is achieved through tracking of requests through a ticketing system and application of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto distribution</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You must track and document all requests for services.
Avoid fulfilling all requests and concentrate on optimizing the most often requested services.
You still need to provide a workable approach for special requests.
The simplest solution is to advocate using a commercial offering.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_approaches">Approaches</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am working with teams developing software products in academic and small-company environments.
The needs boil down to</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide docker images to developers.
The images shall be accessible from the company Intranet and often form the Internet,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide virtual images only exceptionally,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide git repositories,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide development tools such as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket solutions including Pages for documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most often, virtual images are only needed when the user needs a Microsoft or macOS environment.
All Unix related requests are serviced through docker images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A need trend is the need to provide GPU capabilities for machine learning, artificial intelligence and visualization products.
The image approach is still working.
The current major challenge is the immaturity of the software solutions to share efficiently physical GPU.
I expect viable standard solutions will be available in the next two years.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_next_steps">Next Steps</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implement a kiosk self-service solution for all regular requests of collaborators and students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implement a prototype for self-service access to GPU capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Track acceptance of provided approaches and implement improvements.</p>

You can now build, test, and run Java modules via Gradle with the <em>java library</em> plugin.

<p>PMI realized a few years ago, their standard approach to project management was losing ground in the software industry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step was the <em>PMI Agile Certified Practitioner</em> certification to test what agile is.
They never really integrated it with their other certifications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The coup was their acquisition of <em>Disciplined Agile Delivery</em> in the second half of 2019.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciplined_agile_delivery">DAD</a> approach has been around since 2015 and had some success.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The framework has a complexity sympathetic to PMI.
The roots of a lot of DaD concepts can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process">Rational Unified Process</a> <em>RUP</em>.
It is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development">Iterative and Incremental Development</a> methodology.
RUP is certainly not agile.</p>

<p>The library made some strange design decisions.
If you want to persist an instance having fields based on collections, you must use the <em>eager</em> mode.
Beware that you must explicitly commit the transaction if using the <em>eager</em> mode.
The normal mode automatically commits the transaction.
I hope that the API improves, and the behavior is coherent for similar functions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Debugging problems</dt>
<dd>
<p>The source code is currently obfuscated.
Debugging is difficult and cumbersome because variable names are synthetic and all comments are missing.
The source code documentation is shallow and insufficient to understand the behavior of the library.</p>

<p>If you have access to the collection, just call store on the collection.
If the collection is hidden inside an object, you are forced to use an <em>eager</em> store.

<p>In-memory file systems are a must for unit and integration testing.
A continuous integration pipeline does not always have access to a regular file system.
Disk-based file systems are too slow for automatic testing
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We migrate with full success all our unit tests to use in-memory file systems in January 2021.
We use the <a href="https://github.com/google/jimfs">Jimfs</a> library.
When creating a Jimfs file system, you can specify whether it should imitate a UNIX- or Windows-style file system.
They differ in the naming conventions and attribute usage, so choose the one you prefer.
The Windows file system implements some Windows’ quirks, such as not permitting the creation of a file in the root directory.</p>

The <em>MicroStream</em> 4.x releases crash when using record in JDK 15 and JDK 16. It only works with JDK 14.
You are forced to use an obsolete JDK no more supported.
For example, the IntelliJ IDEA stops to provide support for obsolete JDKs as soon as the new official JDK release is available.
It hinders you to use the associated preview features

<a href="#_footnoteref_1">1</a>. I have reported the bug how they used path instances. The developers were very supportive. Version 4.01 supports in-memory file systems such as <a href="https://github.com/google/jimfs">Jimfs</a>.

<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_2">
<a href="#_footnoteref_2">2</a>. I have reported the bug in the microstream forum and informed them that their claim they support these JDK is plain wrong.

</div>
<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_3">
<a href="#_footnoteref_3">3</a>. Version 5.0 was released July 2021 and finally provides support for records. You need to increase access to internal components with the option <em>--add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.misc=ALL-UNNAMED</em> to have a working approach.

<p>Java development won traction since the decision to release every six months a new version to the community.
Preview and incubator features promote feedback from the community and users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some tool builders, such as JetBrains,https://www.jetbrains.com/[] are working proactively and provide support for JDK in developments.
Other tool maintainers such as <a href="https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/">JaCoCo</a> are dreadfully behind the release cycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We learnt to deal with the new speed and how to tackle the laggards.
Some experiences were quite painful.
Below our findings and our current focus on developing software products.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_legibility_matters">Legibility Matters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Programmers learnt the last decade that legibility and brevity of programming languages matter.
The Java <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/coin/">Coin</a> and <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/">Amber</a>
projects were initiated to reduce the verbosity of the Java language mainly through syntactic sugar.
A programmer should not be forced to write statements the compiler could infer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples of improvements are</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Diamond operators <em>to avoid writing two times the same generic parameter declarations</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try with resources <em>to avoid complicated finally blocks to close resources</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple catch of exceptions <em>to avoid writing multiple times the same error handling block</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>var</strong> local variables <em>to avoid complex declarations of local variables</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>default</strong> methods in interfaces <em>to avoid declaring the same method in multiple classes</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strings as switch selector <em>to write readable code instead of huge if statements</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Underscore in numerical constants <em>to increase legibility</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deeper changes are</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>New date API is simplifying the handling of date and time logic.
The solution is based on the learnings of the <a href="https://www.joda.org/joda-time/">Joda</a> time library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support of Lambda constructs greatly eliminates the need for verbose anonymous classes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_useful_constructs">Useful Constructs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modern Java has introduced powerful constructs to write legible and maintainable code.
Modern Java code is quite different from Java 5 code.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Java Modules</dt>
<dd>
<p>Dependencies management supported at language level.<br/>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)/">Ada</a> programming language has support for module since 1985.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Streams and Lambda</dt>
<dd>
<p>Support of functional programming approaches.
Streams are declarative and support internal iterators.<br/>
<em>The Booch Ada component library supported internal iterators since 1985</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Record</dt>
<dd>
<p>Very compact notation to define a data class and transparent handling of properties.
Records are immutable objects and finally use modern naming for getters
<sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_algebraic-types">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Sealed Types</dt>
<dd>
<p>Interesting way to restrict inheritance to a set of selected classes.
Very helpful for library designers.
You can publish an interface in the public API and limit the classes implementing this interface<sup class="footnoteref">[<a class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Reflection versus Lambda</dt>
<dd>
<p>References to methods and constructors are part of the lambda extension.
The <em>LambdaMetafactory</em> class allows you to create a reference at runtime.
The reflection operations can be replaced by lambda expressions.
The code is more performant and has security issues.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Text Blocks</dt>
<dd>
<p>We can finally write legible multi-lines strings.</p>

<p>Fluent interface when setting multiple properties in an instance.</p>

<li>
<p>Missing support for modifiable properties (read-only properties have initial support in the record construct).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing logging interface similar to <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">slf4j</a>.</p>

Only runtime exceptions can be thrown in a lambda expression.
Experience with other programming languages shows that checked exceptions do not provide gains in the quality of delivered code.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Pattern matching with deconstruction</dt>
<dd>
<p>First pattern matching constructs are available in switch and if statements.
Discussions are underway to extend pattern matching with object deconstruction.</p>

<p>The only drawback we have with modern Java development is the sluggish catch-up of open-source tools and libraries.

<p>Legacy libraries heavily use <em>File</em> objects in their algorithms and their public interface.
Such libraries do <strong>not</strong> work with in-memory file systems.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The simplest approach is to always provide an API returning streams in addition to file system methods.
It is always possible to map a stream to a file system specific streams for read and write operations.</p>

<p>The more complex approach is to replace all <em>File</em> objects with <em>Path</em> objects.
Ideally, the Java community should declare the <em>File</em> class as a deprecated one.
Another solution would be to extend File with an internal path instance.

<p>Java is the preferred programming language for the majority of teaching institutions around the world.

Students should learn the current way of writing code in Java.</p>
</div>

<p>The actual Java approach is to use streams and renounce in most cases to use instructions such as <em>for</em> or <em>while</em> loops or conditional <em>if</em> statements.
Delegation and lambda constructs often replace inheritance design.</p>

<p>Since JDK 16 Java provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type">Algebraic Data Types</a> with records and sealed classes.

Currently, constructs such as records, sealed classes, closeable resources, switch instructions as expressions are new approaches to write legible Java code.
Concepts such as Optional, Streams, immutable objects, and unchecked expressions promote more functional programming styles.</p>

<div class="paragraph">

<p>Domain Driven Design <em>DDD</em> is a powerful and modern approach to define agile software architecture.
Some key rules are related to identity.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Entity has a wel-defined identity</dt>
<dd>
<p>An entity is an object that is not defined by its attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and its identity.
Any instance of an entity abstraction must have a unique identifier.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Identify aggregate through identity</dt>
<dd>
<p>An aggregate is a group of objects that are bound together by a root entity, called the aggregate root.
Objects outside the aggregate are allowed to hold references to the root but not to any other object of the aggregate.
The aggregate root is responsible for checking the consistency of changes in the aggregate.
An aggregate is found and referenced through the identifier of the aggregate root entity.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Reference over aggregate through identity</dt>
<dd>
<p>An aggregate shall reference other aggregate through the identity of their root entity instance.</p>

<p>Always try to find an external, well-defined identifier for your entities.
Beware of legal aspects when you are using government defined identifiers such as social security numbers, passport numbers or car numbers.</p>

<p>This post discusses the value object pattern, and the factory pattern which are tactical patterns in the domain driven design
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">DDD</a> approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Value objects represent typed values that have no conceptual identity in your domain.
They can help you write better codes that are less error-prone, more performant and more expressive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Value objects define the second kind of domain objects besides entities.
Their main characteristic is immutability:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Attributes of a value object <strong>never</strong> change</em>.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A second characteristic is that they do not have external identifiers.
Unlike an entity, two value objects with the exact same properties are considered equal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A third one is they should be self-validating.
A value object shall verify the validity of its attributes when being created.
If any of its attributes are invalid, the object should not be created and an error or exception should be raised.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object">Value Objects</a> do have attributes and methods as entities.
Attributes of value objects are immutable.
Methods of value objects can only be queries without side effects.
Operations never command a change to the internal state of a value object.
We can pass value objects to clients without worrying they change them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many objects can be modeled as value objects instead of entities because they are defined through their attributes.
These objects measure, quantify or describe things in the domain model.
Because they are so easy to handle, we should model domain abstractions as value objects as often as possible.</p>

<h3 id="_addresses_phone_numbers_email_addresses">Addresses, Phone Numbers, Email Addresses</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some value objects are part of any commercial application domain.
Postal addresses, phone numbers and email addresses are canonical value objects.
Other candidates are bank account IBAN numbers, job titles, job descriptions, company legal status.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means that these objects do not have an object identifier and should not be stored in a separate table if stored in an SQL database.
Value objects shall be embedded objects and be part of an object such as a person.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A person is an entity.
It should have an external identifier and has a postal address, multiple phone numbers, and one or more email addresses.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Check your domain model and validate these assumptions.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Postal address, phone numbers, email addresses are value objects and have no external or internal identifiers.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>They are immutable objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business processes can replace such an object with a new instance without impeding other domain instances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programmed in modern Java, these value objects should be <strong>records</strong> to guaranty immutability at the language level.
As a bonus, you get the <strong>hashCode</strong> and <strong>equals</strong> methods for free.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Invoice lines are lines containing details in an invoice.
Invoice lines are always value objects belonging to exactly one invoice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To complicate matter, invoice lines have different types, such as a regular line with a specific article, quantity, unit price and computed price.
Often VAT aspects must be considered and computed for the overall invoice.
An invoice line can also be a subtotal for a set of regular invoice lines.</p>

<p>The following design challenges exist</p>

<p>Serialization libraries such as JSON Jackson library cannot handle invoice lines with multiple Java class types.
A workable approach is described and implemented with the open source component <a href="http://blog.tangly.net/docs/gleam/">Gleam</a>.
The solution is to define selectors to instantiate the correct Java class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invoices are complex objects and ideal candidates for a document-oriented persistent approach.
Invoices should not be stored in a relation based persistence store, meaning an SQL database.
To store them in a table, you have to model the various types of lines and add a technical identifier to each invoice line instance.</p>

<h3 id="_factories">Factories</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The factory pattern in Domain Driven Design <em>DDD</em> can be seen as a super pattern for the Gang of Four (GoF) creation patterns.
Factories are concerned with creating new entities and value objects.
They also validate the invariants for the newly created objects.
We can place a factory on the entity or value object itself or on an independent object.</p>

Invalid objects cannot be constructed if the constructor validation detects a violation.
This mechanism ensures only valid instances exist in the domain.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Factories that are declared on the same object they create are either factory methods or prototype methods.
The factory method creates a completely new object from the method parameters.
The prototype method uses an existing instance to derive a new object.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the creation logic is complex or has dependencies that are not needed by the created object.
It is best to create a separate factory.

<p>Some information on the Internet about <a href="https://utteranc.es/">utteranc.es</a> is wrong.
Facts are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Utterances library uses a GitHub repository to store comments associated with your website articles and pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your website can be hosted <strong>anywhere</strong>.
You do <strong>not</strong> need to host your static website repository on GitHub; but you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Readers wanting to comment <strong>must</strong> login once with their GitHub account to authorize the <a href="https://utteranc.es/">utteranc.es</a> application.
Anonymous commenting is not supported.
<em>This restriction is reasonable for a technical website whose readers are technically affine and already have a GitHub account.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utterance products are free.
It claims to have no tracking, no advertisement, and no lock-in.
The comments are stored in your repository as GitHub issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utterances layout looks nice and can be styled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Utterances is an open source app built and maintained by Jeremy Danyow.
He announced the project in 2018.
It provides a lightweight web widget <em>&lt;iframe&gt;</em> to add a comment section to a website.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When someone posts a comment, the Utterances bot literally leaves a corresponding comment on the issue.
In other words, each page gets its own issue with a comment feed, and so you benefit from the entire feature set of issues out-of-the-box.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Comments are stored as issues inside a GitHub repository of your choosing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can edit, report and delete comments.
<em>These functions are great for moderation.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are watching the repository, you will get email notifications when comments are posted to your site.</p>

<p>At many customer sites I visit, I see a lot of effort being put into classifying and managing bugs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Their bug list may contain more than a thousand items.
All are neatly documented with screenshots, ways to reproduce the problem and a severity and impact classification.
In the worst case, a specialist has worked hard and estimated the effort to correct each of these bugs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A change management board meets every few weeks and decides which bugs have a higher priority and should urgently be fixed.
It means an angry customer called someone at C level.
Now his request must be handled.
Some of these bugs were discovered years ago.
The discussion can take hours and involve up to ten people.
Clearly, many expensive hours have been invested to properly administering these bugs.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating a list of errors provides an organized inventory of technical debt.
Spending time on evaluating and administering bugs with the goal of tracking them is just wasteful.

<p>The bugs that the team decides to fix must be prioritized over regular work and must get fixed <strong>now</strong>.
In Scrum the <a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-backlog">product backlog item</a> containing the bug has the highest priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the beginning, there will be more bugs to work through, as some bugs that were deleted will be reported again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the team shifts its focus to improved quality, there will be fewer of them.
This is truly a binary system with no wiggle room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugs are either fixed now or deleted, there is no severity and no haggling about the classification of a bug!
Good practice is before fixing the glitch to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit test</a> to reproduce the problem.
You guarantee your users will never see the same error.
It is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing">non-regression testing</a> and makes your customers very happy.</p>

<p>To Waisfisz, an organization’s culture is defined by how its parts relate to each other.
Moreover, it refutes <em>the way we do things here</em> model by reinforcing that your internal culture is defined by its differences from other organizations.
This model lends from group dynamics where groups are not only defined by their internal identity but also by their differences to other groups.</p>

<li>
<p>Organizations are implicitly optimized to avoid changing the status quo middle- and first-level manager and <strong>specialist</strong> positions and power structures.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>As a corollary to (1), any change initiative will be derided as <strong>purist</strong>, <strong>theoretical</strong>, <strong>revolutionary</strong>, <strong>religion</strong>, and <strong>needing pragmatic customization for local concerns</strong> — which deflects from addressing weaknesses and manager/specialist status quo.</p>

More than 80% of all software development initiatives claim to be agile.
A digital and agile enterprise is two sides of the same coin.
Almost all research and development departments are implementing agile processes to achieve faster and better results.

By dynamic, we mean you can add values without recompiling the source code.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I hosted my technical blogs on <a href="https://www.blogger.com/">blogger</a> for years.
If I correctly remember I started to use blogger ten years ago.
It is a great tool with some drawbacks.
Over the years, the drawbacks sting more and more:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Their editor is brittle, with limited functionality and unreliable.
The generated HTML is not legible and does not support concepts such a micro fragments, meta information or simple functions such as source code highlighting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last quarters they started to tinker with their editor and output format.
My older posts are now a mess and can only be open in the HTML mode.
If I switch to their WYSIWYG editor, the layout is destroyed and random fonts family and sizes are displayed.
Worse, the blogs are also displayed mangled to the readers even if I do not edit them.
This destruction of all older blogs and the missing migration path were killer criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blogger does not support modern markup language such <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> or <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a>.
Blogger uses a proprietary and not easy to port format.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is <strong>time</strong> to find an alternative, and I have to confess I am a huge fan of <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, so why not go with Markdown?
Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing bad with Markdown - except that no one should probably use it when <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a> and Asciidoctor are available.
I’m writing all my documents with <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following needs are identified:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>I shall write blogs with the selected solution.
The blogs shall be written in <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a>.
The blog platform should support multiple years of publishing and referencing between blogs.
Our projects and our collaborators put effort to regularly publish articles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I shall be able to write technical articles and publish them on the same site.
The articles are naturally written in <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a>.
We want professional looking documentation to encourage new users to try our open source components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I shall publish the technical documentation of the open source components I develop on the same site.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> was selected as static site generator because its support for <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a> is tremendously improving.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Static website generators have strong advantages for technical savvy people:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hosting is cheap.
GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket pages even host static websites for free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source files go into Git for backup and history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source files are in plain text:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Changes come in as a <em>Pull Request</em> for proper review and CI pipeline validation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sources are open in our IDEs, which encourages refactoring them alongside the code.
This results in less stale content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First I used the <a href="https://github.com/thingsym/hugo-theme-techdoc/">hugo-theme-techdoc</a> to customize <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.
It worked great for the technical documentation and technical articles but fell short of my wishes for the blog part.
When I discover the theme <a href="https://www.docsy.dev/">Docsy</a>.
It supports the technical documentation, technical articles, and blogging.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best part is that <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> now supports <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a> natively.
No more strange manipulation to load <em>gem</em> modules you need.
And diagrams through asciidoc-diagram and plantUml are generated in the expected folders.
The documentation is still on the light side, but you find the need information on the various pull requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bonus is that <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a> newer versions have native support for <em>rouge</em> syntax highlighter.
It is no more necessary to load <em>pygment</em> highlighter and configure CSS files.
Another huge gain is that <em>plantuml</em> and other diagrams are generated at the right location.</p>

Tags are often defined as a crowd ontology without enforced schemas.
Invest in domain modeling to define and maintain tags, and you will move tags to full-fledged ontology into your domain models.
This ontology supports meaningful search, segmentation and reporting over historical and geographical raw data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tags with associated values are also used to decorate unrelated entities with orthogonal information.
For example, you can associate geographical coordinates – GIS – to pictures, meetings, or addresses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A tag has three parts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>an <em>optional namespace</em> to classify the tag in the overall ontology,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a <em>mandatory name</em> to uniquely identify the tag in the context of its optional namespace,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an <em>optional value</em> providing details to the tag</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, we could define a tag such as <em>geo:longitude=50.167958</em> to provide the meta information of longitude to an entity.
This tag has a namespace <em>geo</em>, a name <em>longitude</em> and a double value <em>50.167958</em>.</p>

<p>You should strongly consider the introduction of tag types to constrain the possible values of a specific tag.
For example, you can define that the namespace geo contains only the tags longitude and latitude.
Both these tags have mandatory values of type double.
Once your design supports tag types, you can add generic validation rules in the user interface and in business logic for all existing tags.</p>

<p>Avoid using the internal identifier to communicate with external systems.
If you respect this rule, you are free to migrate your objects to another identification scheme in the future.
New schemes are often helpful when the application grows, or you have later to import and take over a lot of legacy data.</p>

It should always be visible outside the system and used in any API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try to have exactly one external identifier per object to communicate with external systems.
This restriction is a corollary of the rule stating an instance is owned by exactly one system.
This system is the one defining and managing the external unique identifiers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should clearly define the owning system for the external identification scheme.
This information shall be documented and accessible to all involved parties.
This process is part of the enterprise architecture activities of your ecosystem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>External identifier ownership is often a murky situation when working with legacy systems.
You often have multiple sources of external identifiers, sometimes overlapping and sometimes no covering all instances.
You have to formulate a long-term strategy to clean up your landscape and handle the problems until these clean-up activities are completed.
By handling we mean administrative and import rules matching the various external identifiers to the same object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One possible solution is to use tags.
Store externally defined identifiers as tags.
Document these tags as specific for the external system.
This approach scales to multiple external identifiers, and multiple systems managing the same external identifier.
So you have a scalable approach and do not pollute your domain model with spurious information defined in external systems.
Upon completion of refactoring these tags document historical information and could safely be removed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multiple external object identifiers imply the existence of mapping functions to identify the object referenced.
Because the ownership of external identifiers is outside your system, you are dependent on these systems and have to hope they are good citizens.
The key rule of good systems is that they never change external identifiers.
As soon as you modify identifiers, they are per definition no more real identifiers.</p>

<h3 id="_names_name">Names <em>name</em></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The entity name is a human-readable name to distinguish between entity instances.
Ideally, it should be almost unique.
The fallback is to use the external unique identifier <em>id</em> known to all external systems.
The drawback is that we have no guarantee it is legible for users.
Names are essential for well-designed user interfaces.
Never require from your users memorizing external identifiers, please provide names.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the first and last names of a person is the name for a natural entity.
Social security number is a possible external identifier.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://www.paymentstandards.ch/dam/downloads/ig-qr-bill-en.pdf">Swiss QR-bill</a> standard is based on a 2D barcode and associated human-readable text mirroring the data encoded in the barcode.
The barcode approach assumes the invoice will be printed by the buyer.
The interested parties have to scan the barcode to digitize the invoice information.
This approach clearly breaks digitalization efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our approach is to add the barcode to the PDF invoice document.
The workflow can open the digitally received document and parse programmatically the image of the barcode.
The generation of the invoice and associated barcode is fully digital.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach works well only if the issuer fills the so-called SWICO field of the QR code with needed information.
For example, the due date of the invoice and the enumeration of different VAT tax percentages and corresponding VAT taxes are only stored in this field.
In other words, the standard does not foresee that the due date of the invoice should be a mandatory field.
Stated bluntly, the committee in charge of the standard realized they missed and stuck all missing elements in the so-called SWICO field.
It is clear that it is impossible to define a digital payment workflow without information on such a due date, and the VAT percentages and amounts.</p>

It can also be used for B2B invoices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>XML is not really a human-readable format.
A JSON-based approach would have been more friendly.
The advantage is that the standard contains all relevant information for an invoice and streamline the digital processing of invoices.
You can easily define a workflow extracting and parsing the XML payload from all received invoices, and feeding the information to your ERP system for further processing.</p>

<p>The library <a href="https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/mustangproject">Mustang ZUGFerD</a> is a mature and usable solution to read and write digital ZUGFeRD invoices.

ZUGFeRD additionally can transform a PDF/A-1 into a PDF/A-3 format.</p>

<h3 id="_approach">Approach</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We decided to extend our open source library to create digital invoices.
The extensions support the Swiss QR Code and the ZUGFeRD 2.1 standards.
All the information is stored in one PDF document.
This document is sent electronically to the customer.</p>
</div>

<p>Our current approach is</p>

*Generate* PDF version of Invoice using AsciiDocPDF
    *Add* Swiss QR code as last page in the PDF invoice document
    *Add* ZUGFeRD XML payload in the PDF invoice document</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Currently, we do not generate PDF/A1 documents as required in the ZUGFeRD standard.
PDFBox could provide the tool box to generate in this format, but it would be quite an endeavor.
An extension to PDFBox with similar functionality to iText would ideally become available in the future.
Otherwise, we have to write the missing code; in particular the embedding of fonts, pictures and files into the PDF document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We selected the AsciiDoc format to provide a simple approach to custom templates for invoices.
We avoided proprietary solutions based on Microsoft Office templates.</p>

<p>In computer programming and software design, code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, or implementation of the software (its non-functional attributes), while preserving its functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With refactoring you can take bad design, even chaos software, and rework it into well-designed code.
Most often, it is cheaper to refactoring a legacy application instead of rewriting it from scratch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simply put, refactoring is a way of decreasing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">Technical Debt</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two general categories of benefits to the activity of refactoring.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Maintainability</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is easier to fix bugs because the source code is easy to read and the intent of its author is easy to grasp.
This might be achieved by reducing large monolithic routines into a set of individually concise, well-named, single-purpose methods.
It might be achieved by moving a method to a more appropriate class, or by removing misleading comments.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Extensibility</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is easier to extend the capabilities of the application if it uses recognizable design patterns.
It provides flexibility where none before May have existed.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code.
Yet the internal structure improves.
It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs.
In essence, when you refactor you are improving the design of the code after it has been written.</p>

<h3 id="_introduction">Introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a developer new to a legacy software solution, it is often hard to understand the existing application.
He must determine the extent of source code and architectural decay, and identify smells and metric violations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Legacy applications are often critical to business and have been in use for years, sometimes decades.
Since business is evolving, there is constant pressure to support additional requirements.
However, changing these applications is difficult and you end up spending an increasing number of resources maintaining the software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many reasons why maintaining legacy software is a difficult problem.
Often, most, if not all, of the original developers are gone, and no one understands how the application is implemented.
The technologies used in the application are no longer current, having been replaced by newer and more exciting technologies.
Also, software complexity increases as it evolves over time as you add new requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key to managing the lifecycle of software is to continuously work as a professional and skilled developer.
A professional engineer <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpportunisticRefactoring.html">opportunistically refactor</a> each time he modifies source code.</p>

<p>The pattern movement was started last millennium.
Very talented and experienced developers have documented how to solve common problems elegantly and effectively.
Depending on the programming language, you are using different idioms are preferred.
The way to solve the same problem is different in Java, Scala, C++, Python or C#.</p>
</div>

<p>You should know all regular structural, behavioral and creational patterns.
Explore your programming language and discover how idioms and patterns have evolved between major releases.
For example, lambda expressions and streams introduced in Java 8 - released Spring 2014 - completely transform the solution for regular business logic.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Javadoc is the standard and hugely helpful approach to document classes and component public interfaces in Java.
Similar tools exist for other programming languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Architecture design records provide hints why specific design decisions were chosen.
Your users can better understand the path you follow and the selected tradeoffs of your design.
They do not have to agree, but they can understand the arguments why you choose so.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Static code generator is an actual good practice to provide the current documentation and tutorials for your components.
We write all our documentation in the <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">Asciidoc</a> format - including <a href="https://plantuml.com/">plantUML</a> and highlighted source code - and generate our website using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> tool suite.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We need <strong>justification</strong> not to use immutable objects in our solutions, rather than an <strong>affirmative reason</strong> to use them.
Records provide a first-class means for modeling data-only aggregates.
They have been available in Java since the release of JDK 14.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Records are often seen as <em>syntactic sugar</em> to easily create <em>immutable objects</em> without having to write too much boilerplate code.
Records as a clean definition of immutable objects can have a tremendous impact on your component design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You as a designer have to reflect why your abstractions are not immutable and what is the rationale behind.
From experience, it improves the quality of your design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Records guarantee:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An immutable class concept which is the strongest argument for the use of record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cannot change their state after construction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t change the state of the whole system in any way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not do side effects, like inputs and outputs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Records provide</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A set of boilerplate methods generated by the Java ecosystem.
These methods are always semantically correct and efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A public constructor initializing all instance variables Getters for all instance variables.
The name of the getters is PropertyType property().
We get rid of the cumbersome and outdated convention <em>PropertyType getProperty()</em> propagated by Java Beans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A semantic correct implementation of <em>hashCode()</em> and <em>equals()</em>.
Your objects can be used in standard API collections without difficult to find bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A human-readable implementation <em>toString()</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The huge advantage of the approach against IDE code generation is the guaranty that these methods are semantically always correct.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_advantages">Advantages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key benefits of immutable objects are:</p>
</div>

<li>
<p>Atomicity of failure</p>

<h3 id="_design_impact">Design Impact</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I updated my open source projects to use the record abstraction.
What a surprise!
I found regularly undocumented trade-offs why a class was not implemented as an immutable type.
Quite often, I was just lazy and took a shortcut.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Records motivate you as a clean coder and designer to decide why a class should be mutable or not.
This pressure had a tremendous impact on the quality of my subsystem design.
The Java language guarantees that all record classes must be immutable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Immutable value objects are a cornerstone in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">Domain Driven Design</a> <em>DDD</em> approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you are using Data Transfer Objects, DTO they should probably always be records.
In the long run, you should eliminate your DTO, they are just waste and break all the rules of abstraction and information hiding.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_not_working">What is NOT Working?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Surprisingly most of the processes with private companies providing mandatory services cannot be done electronically due to obsolete information systems and cumbersome processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Accident insurance (BU and NBU) still request declaration of incidents and communication over paper mail,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pension fund insurance company provides a web portal but still send some forms over paper mail,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax declaration must still be printed out and sent to the tax office of the state government.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>None of the government solutions provide modern API.
We still must manually input our data in their portals.
The old interfaces they provide are only partially available through expensive commercial solutions.
By old interfaces we mean proprietary formats and proprietary file transfer solutions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_findings">Findings</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last four years were a game changer.
A lot of manual activities are now fully digitized and often automatized.
We never had to buy a printer.
The last year we seldom had to scan a paper document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The partners still requesting paper interactions are some government agencies and some insurances.
We observe a decrease of such physical interactions. Our partners are steadily - if sometimes slowly - digitizing their workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Slowly digital versions for invoices are emerging.
This approach should allow automated payment workflows.
Interestingly private customers already have billing and e-payment solutions.
Similar solutions for corporate customers are either not available or incredibly limited, cumbersome and expensive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next big step will be the emergence of API to integrate the steps in a workflow specific to the involved companies.
For example the technical part of the onboarding process for a new employee could be fully automated.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continuous delivery is the new approach.
Eliminate hardening iterations, integration phases, milestones when software should be integrated.
Your teams shall deliver a workable software on demand, multiple times a week or a day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Organize around products</em>.
Customers buy products.
Eliminate product based organizations.
*b <em>Have one backlog for the whole product</em>.
Multiple backlogs must be otherwise synchronized and local optimization is de facto applied.
This approach is against all lean principles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Customer and users talks directly with the development team</em>.
Product owners, product managers enterprise architects should never be filtering the information flow between customers and engineers.</p>
</li>

<p><em>Eliminate step by step all coordination roles</em>.
Emphasize communication between developers in the team and between teams.
Scrum of Scrums where only Scrum masters attend, Release Train Engineer, System teams, corporate Solution Engineers are just a waste of resources.</p>

<p>If you are still using Java 8 you are using technologies released in Spring 2014.
You are missing all the improvements in the garbage collector, runtime engine and various API.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java 11 LTS was released in September 2018.
The current LTS release is one year old.
You had one year to migrate to this long term solution version.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is time to modernize the fundament of your application and invest a small amount of effort in it.
The payback is fantastic.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You have economical gains through</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Major performance improvements make your application faster.
You have either higher customer satisfaction or need less processing resources,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Major garbage collector updates make your application more predictable.
The maximum amount of memory is often lower,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better behavior in container environment translates to less resource usage,</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have more legible and maintainable source code</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Since Java 8 useful new language features have been introduced, along with new tooling,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various standard API were extended with convenience methods,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One important change was that internal APIs - largely those classes in packages that started with sun.misc.* - were hidden from use,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>APIs that are not core to the JDK have also been removed in Java 11 or later.
These changes may impact your application but there is a clear path to avoid these problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have to select either the long term support path or upgrade every six months the Java runtime</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When upgrading the choice you face is whether to use the latest version of Java, currently 13 and be prepared to upgrade every six months.
Or upgrade to the latest LTS 11 to give yourself up to three years to think about your next upgrade,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t be tempted to ignore compiler warnings.
Deprecation is being taken much more seriously in this modern Java world, and both Java 10 and Java 11 removed APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In less than two years the next LTS will be released with Java 17. It is scheduled in September 2021.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become more agile</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once over this first upgrade, it is worth at least testing the application on the latest version of Java every 6 months, for example in CI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In all cases openJDK is now the new default.
Various companies - Oracle, Redhat, Amazon, Azul, IBM - provide commercial support for openJDK for different timelines.
You are more flexible with your migration timeline.</p>

<h3 id="_how_to_migrate">How to Migrate?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You do not need to implement Java modules to migrate to Java 9 or beyond.
It is worth the effort to slowly support the module approach.
Your architecture will become more modular and the interfaces are more clearly defined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are basically four incremental phases to fully migrate to Java 11 or later:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Run an existing Java application with the JDK,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile the application with the JDK,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the new features of the current JDK,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modularize the application to use module system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could recompile and run your solution with the new Java version without code changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Changes are necessary if you use deprecated packages or access Sun internal packages.
All deprecated packages have a compatible alternate implementation.
Often you just need to update the import statements.
Sun packages have a documented migration path to alternate approaches providing similar functionality.
By the way Sun company already stated years ago you should not use these internal packages.
So it is time to clean up your code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_call_for_action">Call for Action</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Start now your migration to a modern JDK and leave Java 8 behind you.</p>

<p>Agile approaches encourage common ownership of artifacts during product development.
Historically, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons">commons</a> is the term used for shared resources.
Can we apply the commons learnings to agile and Scrum approaches?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interestingly, economists were kind to state common ownership is doomed to fail through the theory published end of the sixties <a href="#tradegy-commons">[1]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thirty years later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom">Elinor Ostrom</a> showed that commons can indeed work well if you follow a small set of rules.
She found century-old examples scattered around the world.
She was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for her findings in 2009 and dissipated the previous fake news.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The picture shows a <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suone">Suone</a> in Wallis, Switzerland.
The constructions bring water to arid regions and are build and maintained by communities.
It is an example of commons in place for hundreds of years and is one of the concrete implementation studied by Elinor.
Mountain pastures are also managed as commons in Switzerland.
You will find a drawing of Suone on the

<pre>A resource arrangement that works in practice can work in theory.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Elinor Ostrom identified eight design principles of stable local common pool resource management through the world.
These principles have a wider range of applications than common resource pool groups.
They are relevant to nearly any situation where people - such as Scrum teams - must cooperate and coordinate to achieve shared goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below the eight principles are presented with a mapping to Scrum aspects.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum teams define the artifacts and processes exclusively owned by the team.
Teams take ownership of items such as source code, Scrum board, pull process.
Other items, such as refactoring process, incident tickets produce more infighting.
You can measure the maturity of your team accordingly to the clarity which resources they own exclusively.
The first step shall often be <em>collective ownership of source code</em> and <em>common coding style</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_appropriation_and_provision_of_common_resources_that_are_adapted_to_local_conditions">The appropriation and provision of common resources that are adapted to local conditions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agile teams own commons resources such as * <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeOwnership.html">Collective ownership of source code</a>, * Definition of Done DoD, * Sprint Backlog, * Coding Guidelines, * Team rules and work techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The work techniques often limit common resources in inexperienced teams.
They ask the product owner if they could refactor a class or invest a few minutes in clean code techniques.
They do not own the internal quality of the product.
More mature teams are able to make the transition with the support of their Scrum master and the organization.
They truly own the source code and its quality.</p>

<h3 id="_collective_choice_arrangements_that_allow_most_resource_appropriators_to_participate_in_the_decision_making_process">Collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> or <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> have quite a few platforms to support decision-making process * Daily Scrum, * Retrospective, * Review, * Backlog refinement, * Planning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The decision-making process works only if the organization grants psychological security to their teams.
In my experience, it takes years until an organization discards command and control reflexes and delegates responsibility and accountability to the Scrum team members.
Daily Scrum events are often reporting meetings.
The developers report either to the Scrum master, or the product owner, or a manager.
The events are seldom a platform to collaborate, discuss options and experiment with variants.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consensus or consent approaches are widely more successful than majority decisions is one of the findings of Elinor.</p>

<p>Most teams need counseling before they can tackle the concept of sanctions.
As a Scrum master you must gently empower them to sanction.
If this rule is not implemented, you will always land in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of commons</a> and utterly fail in your agile journey.
Worse, your product will probably also fail.</p>

<p>You are applying the agile, lean approach to your software product development.
Your teams use Scrum or Kanban to deliver running software every two weeks.</p>

<p>Agile architecture is a key element to improve the quality of your solution and reduce overall cycle-time of your product delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your journey toward greater business agility starts by identifying what outcomes are most important to your company’s success.
Outcomes are codified in functional and non-functional requirements your product shall fulfill.
A key component is to find out how to create a great resilient architecture within the Scrum framework.</p>

<p>What Is Agile Architecture?
An agile architecture shall have four characteristics.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrum and the <a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum Guide</a> are silent how architecture activities are performed during sprints.
We can use the Scrum values, the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum Guide</a> and the
<a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile Manifesto Principles</a> to infer approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The architect shall be part of the Scrum development team.
This is the most embedded way an architect would fit into a Scrum team.
It may not even be an individual who has the title of an architect.
The big idea behind Scrum teams is that team members have different skills.
Their roles may change to deliver what is required for a particular sprint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So it could be that senior developers within the team got architecture skills.
They are in the best position, or have the best knowledge, to make those architectural decisions.
Those team members with architectural skills are involved in the sprint on a day-to-day basis.
They attend the daily Scrum meetings, take items off the backlog, and work on them.</p>

For bigger systems use the good practices described in <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a>.</p>

<p>The well-established practices from the object-oriented and DevOps communities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Develop very early a working skeleton.</p>

<li>
<p>Clean architecture implies clean code and requires clean coders in your team.

<li>
<p>Be part of the team, work daily with team members and attend all team events.</p>

<li>
<p>Use architecture design record ADR and light documentation to describe architecture decisions - meaning no lengthy Software Architecture Document SAD or overwhelming UML models -.</p>

<li>
<p>Be a master programmer and writes code in the application technological stack.
He writes actual source code as current good practices are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have rich knowledge of architecture and design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have mentioned refactoring, which is how we evolve an ever-improving design and architecture while building the product incrementally.
To do that, we need to know the difference between good architecture and design and not-so-good.
We need a rich pool of architecture and design options in our bag of tricks, ranging from very simple options to the more complex and rich options that we may need as the system grows.
One never knows too much about the quality of architecture, code, and design.
One does, of course, need to apply that knowledge smoothly, incrementally, little by little.</p>

<p>Once good practices are established, you can move to more sophisticated tools - such as git history code analysis - to uncover weaknesses in your development department.</p>

<p>Teams ready to learn from the like of Google could evaluate <a href="https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/">Trunk Based Development</a> and consider long-lived branches as waste.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_code_review">Code Review</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A code review can be done in different ways.
Many teams use GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab.
A very common approach for our code reviews is using merge requests.
However, there are situations where pull requests are not necessary.
For example, if a feature is implemented in pair programming or mob programming then the code is already reviewed while it is written.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We decided that it does not have to be reviewed again but of course, everybody may look at the commits later on in GitHub and add comments.
A rule of thumb we agreed upon is that every line of code has to be approved by at least one other developer before it is pushed into our master branch.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_pull_requests_in_trunk_based_development">Pull Requests in Trunk-Based Development</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In trunk-based development it is different.
Since we want to merge our commits into the master branch as quickly as possible, we cannot wait until the complete feature is finished.
Unlike in the original trunk-based development approach we still use feature branches, but we have much less divergence from the master branch than in Git Flow.
We create a pull request as soon as the first commit is pushed into the feature branch.
Of course, that requires that no commit breaks anything or causes tests to fail.
Remember that unfinished features can always be disabled with feature toggles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, with part of the new feature committed and the pull request created, another developer from the team can review it.
In most cases, that does not happen immediately because the developers don’t want to interrupt their work every time a team member pushes a commit.
Instead, the code reviews are done when another developer is open for it.
Meanwhile, the pull request might grow by a few commits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code is not always reviewed immediately after the commit.
In most cases it reaches the master branch much quicker than in Git Flow.</p>

<p>As a young developer, I loved Linux, compiled new kernels during evening sessions and struggled days to have the correct drivers for the graphic card and communication components of my notebook.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I grew older and decided to enjoy my weekends, family and outdoor activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And surely I shall have no virus, trojan and other evils on my workstation.
So I went to macOS and Apple notebooks without regrets.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_gains">Gains</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The major gains using macOS are * Still no virus scanner is necessary, the speed-up during complex programming and development activities is tremendous, * No trouble when updating OS, updates are automatic and often no new start is required, Unix command line and tools are available in the console.
Homebrew provides all known and less-known utilities and programs available under Linux.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>My previous MacBook is now six years old and still used as a development backup platform.
The performance is still very good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My preferred IDE Intellij IDEA works flawlessly on macOS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My new MacBookPro is perfect for Java development, database integration and running multiple Docker images locally.
The 32 GB RAM goes a long way to run multiple docker images and databases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No virus scanner is still important.
I was lately at a customer site.
The whole deployment just crashed because IT department decided to update the virus scanner and associated options.
Suddenly, the generated artifacts were considered harmful.
This decision just broke the CI/CD pipeline for hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> easily downloads and installs newer versions of favorite applications and utilities.
It solved the dread of macOS slow or missing application updates.
Pre-installed Unix utilities are seldom kept up to date by Apple.
Just use Homebrew and forget about Apple slow updates.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_daily_development">Daily Development</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tools I really enjoy and use on a daily basis for software development - mainly Java - are</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> IDE is still a dream.
It could sometimes be slightly snappier but still the best Java IDE under the sky.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>

<li>
<p>Atlassian Cloud applications - <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> and CI pipeline - and SourceTree for some git operations.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> as container manager - for complex product you can run locally kubernetes.</p>

<li>
<p><em><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> is my default browser.
I almost never use _Safari</em> or <em>Firefox</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I retired <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> because I do not need any virtual machines.
They were replaced with Docker images, I stopped using MacPorts.
Homebrew is more than enough for my needs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_daily_work">Daily Work</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tools I used to perform administrative work are * <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> - going strong and better every year -, * Google Business for teamwork in the cloud using collaborative tools, * Apple Mail Client with GPG plugin for PGP and S/MIME secure email, * A local Swiss article <a href="https://www.banana.ch/">Banana</a> for accounting and VAT reports for the federal government.
I bought it as soon as the company stopped requesting higher prices for macOS than for the other platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I still have no need to use any Microsoft applications.
My findings are inline with the ones in my <a href="../../2016/macbook-pro-love">older blog</a> in March 2016.
I hope Apple will still produce high-quality hardware and software in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only big macOS improvement I am waiting for from Apple is that Apple delegate the installation and update of Unix applications and utilities to Homebrew.
Apple is sadly always behind the release cycle of regular Unix programs.
Homebrew does a way better job to support software developers.</p>

Now you can analyze the set of files the team mainly modifies and maintains.
If none can be found, you have diffuse code ownership and will have quality issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">domain driven design</a> <em>DDD</em> terminology, bounded domains are developed and maintained through one team.
This approach encourages architectural purity, continuous refactoring, and accountability.</p>

<p>Each time you find a set of source code artifacts only modified by a single individual you have identified a major off-boarding risk.
When this developer will leave the department or the company, all knowledge associated with the development and the maintenance of these components will immediately be lost.</p>

<p>Agile approaches are not enough.
You need a strong engineering culture to achieve quality and lasting success.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often, coaches and Scrum masters tinker with the processes and invest effort and blood to improve the ceremonies and the company structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But at the end of the day, the success of your application is defined by its adequacy to customers&#39; needs and its overall quality.
You need a solid and professional engineering culture to produce high-quality products and release them at high rate.
If not you just release a new set of defects to your paying customers.</p>

<p>Values drive your culture and the daily behavior of all your collaborators.
But even if you have invested time and blood to identify the right values and put all the mechanisms in place, it might still not have the desired results.
Culture is something that happens daily through personal interactions.
Putting the right values and mechanisms in place will help move your company in the right direction, but it’s not a guaranty for success.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to increase your odds for success, you need to live and breath your values.
You need to truly believe at all levels in the organization and not compromise on them.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Validate that all teams are living up to their values.
Find a way to measure it.
Identify and put actions in place in case you need to improve.
If a value does not make sense, e.g. the value was defined early on, but in hindsight it doesn’t fit with your company, then get rid of it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Building a great engineering culture is not something that you easily do.
You cannot cheat.
It will not automatically happen by copying the values and organization structure from another company such as Spotify.
You need to really invest in creating a culture that works for your company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can look at organizational structures, values and principles from other companies to get inspired.
Sit down with your people and decide together what is important for your company.
Put mechanisms in place that will support the concepts, allow them to grow.
Then live and breathe it within all levels of your company.</p>

<p>It is official.
The power engine of SAFe 4.6 vehicle is team and technical agility.
View the <a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/whats-new-in-safe-46/">official presentation</a> and more important download the
<a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/whats-new-in-safe-46">slides</a>.
It is one of their five Lean Enterprise competencies and one of their four core values.
SAFe finally recognizes the tremendous importance of <a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/team-and-technical-agility/">technical proficiency and craftsmanship</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They advocate two findings.
First, you need team agility, how you apply Scrum or Kanban.
In other words <em>being agile instead of doing agile</em>.
Second, you need technical agility, how you develop a quality product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I challenge you.
If you are following <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a>, talk with your teams and checks how many of their official good practices are you using on a daily basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have seen <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> introductions in Swiss, German and Czech companies.
Attention was set on the structure of the release train and a lot of effort was spent on the various ceremonies, meetings and artifacts.
But how to produce quality software and apply technical excellence was sadly always an afterthought.
And more than once a senior <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> coach just publicly stated that the <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> core value x is not so important for a successful introduction.
Quite a denial approach of his own methodology I think!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be honest with yourself and your teams, either you implement the techniques described in <a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework" class="bare">https://v46.scaledagileframework</a>
.com/team-and-technical-agility/[Technical Agility] and <a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/built-In-quality/">Build-In Quality</a> chapters of <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> or you are
not agile and have no <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> power engine.
It is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">cargo cult</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good starting point are the five dimensions of build-in quality described in <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> 4.6.
And yes now <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> acknowledged the tremendous importance of a
<a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/continuous-delivery-pipeline/">continuous delivery pipeline</a>.
Experts agree you can apply DevOps only if you have continuous integration, delivery and deployment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you realize where your organization stands remember that build-in quality is one of tour core values of <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a>.
That I mean is walk the talk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And please read some Internet blogs and books about <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship">Software Craftsmanship</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">Extreme Programming</a>, TDD, ATTD, clean code.
Most of these concepts were defined and published in the last millennium.
It is time your teams finally adopt them and produce high quality, maintainable and cost-effective products.
This is the whole concept of the lean movement.
And I welcome the fact that <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> now explicitly mention <a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/built-in-quality/">Cost of Delay</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the strengths of <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> is their clear statement that an agile organization transformation is only successful with lean-agile leadership.
All C-level managers are trained in lean and agile, they advocates these approaches and are visible champions.
Therefore all managers shall be advocate technical excellence on a daily basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If not the seminal work of John Kotter clearly states the transformation will fail.
You will have a bunch of Scrum teams in your development department, but have none of the expected synergies at product or company level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Personally I prefer the <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> approach, but I respect your choice - <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a>,
<a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/nexus-guide">Nexus</a>, or <a href="https://www.scrumatscale.com/scrum-at-scale-guide/">Scrum@Scale</a> - as long as technical excellence is
a key aspect of your agile strategy.
Embrace technical agility and do not let your train of teams produce mediocre software every two weeks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Employ professional software craftsmen and deliver quality products.
Follow your <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> approach, respect one of the <a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/safe-core-values/">four core values</a> and one of the
<a href="https://v46\.scaledagileframework.com/">five core competencies</a> of your method.</p>

<p>The other big improvement is that the PI horizon is now <em>limited</em> to 8 or 12 weeks.
No more semesterly or hopefully quarterly cadence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It still does no make sense to plan for three months and at the same time advocate DevOps and design thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DevOps has a time horizon of days, it is waste to have huge quarterly PI gatherings and plans just to discard them after the next DevOps finding.
You should probably just update your PI roadmap.</p>

<h3 id="_call_for_action">Call for Action</h3>

<p>My call for action is fewer meetings and paper artifacts and more technical excellence.

<p>In huger organizations, the development teams discuss their context and select the subset of the activities that all teams think they realistically can do during the Sprint.
This is their initial Definition of Done.
The teams that can do more will expand this product <em>Definition of Done</em> within their members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The difference between the Definition of Done and Potentially Shippable is referred to as Undone Work.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><em>Potentially Shippable - Definition of Done = Undone Work</em></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Sprint is planned according to the <em>Definition of Done</em> and thus the <em>Undone Work</em> is excluded.
It is planned to be left undone.</p>

<p>The terms <em>Potentially Shippable</em> and <em>Definition of Done</em> are often not used consistently.

<p>Teams should never leave work-in-progress at the end of the Sprint and “carry over” to the next one.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The extension of the definition of done to deliver a potentially shippable product has often significant and profound impact on the structure of the organization and its processes.
Experienced agile coaches use the definition of done as an instrument for organizational changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the undone work is slowly removed from the delivery process, it triggers structural and process changes.
For example, the separate quality department responsible for the final tests is dissolved and their expertise is integrated in the development teams.</p>

Health check of your product and your development approach are certainly a good solution.</p>

<p>This post is the first of a series of articles identifying health checks with different focus.
We will identify strengths, potential weaknesses and hopefully find room for improvement.</p>

<p>The patient solely decides if a health check shall be performed.
The effort and depth of a health check are defined together with the patient.
The findings are considered confidential.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A short check with a feedback workshop presenting the insights requires around two work days.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A deeper and more intensive check requests more effort, between one and four weeks.
Upon completion, you can also hire a coach to implement selected findings and improve durably the health of your application.
The findings are often clear and the measures are straightforward.
The real work is to implement consistently the measures.</p>

<p>How clean, legible and maintainable is your source code?
Often it is best to start your health evaluation with your product source code.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One nice aspect of source code checks is that a whole set of tools is available on the market.
You still need an expert to provide the diagnostic but the gathering of data can be automated and quite inexpensive to gather.</p>

<p>First teams have successfully used Scrum to develop applications.
The news spread out and everybody wants to apply Scrum.
It is time to introduce Enterprise wide Agile with Scrum or Kanban or XP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your Company wants to introduce Enterprise Agility in their product development, quality assurance and sales departments.
The company as a whole shall transition to an agile organization and all teams shall adopt <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html">Shu Ha Ri</a> approach for such a change process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on our exhaustive experience, we recommend starting with a set of workshops with the goal of defining a tailored approach to adapt the structure and processes of the company and introduce enterprise agile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These workshops provide the platform to identify the company’s needs and strategic goals, and gather support from all participants.
Try the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">open space</a> format to involve all collaborators and identify their needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below we provide an approach which must be later tailored to the specific needs of the Company during the above-mentioned workshops.
The organizational needs for feature oriented planning and development of an application portfolio should be considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_approach">Approach</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We work with the Shu Ha Ri agile approach when introducing enterprise agile in the Company.
All collaborators will progress from the novice level through the proficient level before reaching the expert level.
You can also use the agile fluency model if you prefer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This model also maps very well to the “Awareness – Desire – Knowledge – Ability – Reinforcement “or ADFAR model.
The Company has already reached awareness and desire level because they want to introduce enterprise agile.
We describe below the activities for the development organization consisting of software development, product management and quality insurance departments, and the activities at company level.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_development_organization">Development Organization</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_shu_novice_level_learn_the_rules">Shu - Novice Level - „Learn the Rules“</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The duration of the novice level is at least six months.
The major activities are to align the collaborators and provide the needed knowledge through training and hands-on exercises.
Extensive training is aligned with experiences and industrial best practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All collaborators shall attend an introduction to agile and Scrum approaches.
All technical collaborators shall attend the Scrum - Master or Developer - training.
Each group of technical collaborators will learn specific techniques and skills necessary to work effectively in an agile product environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The agile coaches have two roles.
First, they facilitate and support the teams to implement all meetings, artifacts, and rules of the Scrum approach.
Second, they train the team members how to use learnt techniques such as clean code, pair programming, pair check-in, agile architecture, requirements elicitation, test driven development, agile quality assurance, acceptance test driven development, continuous integration, deployment and delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the initial training, the coaches ensure that this knowledge and ground rules are applied in daily activities.</p>

<p>Discuss the fact that the standard competencies of agile leadership and coaching – mentoring, facilitating, problem-solving, and conflict navigating – are essential to agile adoption, but simply not enough to sustain and grow agility within an organization.
We find that the unique blend of combining senior internal leaders with experienced agile coaches provides an unprecedented learning environment for all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand that most organizations adopt agile <em>Outside-In</em> - that means they start with a process change and expose organizational impediments.
The problem is that most of the organizational impediments are driven from cultural values deep within the organization.
The process changes rarely stick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify an &#34;Inside-Out&#34; approach - that means we will start with the company culture.
Just as understanding the personality of a person is a key to working effectively with that person, understanding the culture of an organization is critical to its success in adopting, and more importantly sustaining, agility.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Answer the question, “<em>Why move to Agile?</em>” This is important, as the reasons for attempting such a fundamental change should be well understood from both a quantitative and qualitative standpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the current business culture.
Change is hard and there will be champions as well as potential saboteurs of the changes to come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend time on the organization structure to understand how it helps or hinders the move to agile and lean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Involve all levels of the business, including top level ‘C’ executives.
Their sponsorship and support will be important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t neglect mid-level management as their support is vital to the success of the transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a roadmap with the explicit understanding that it will change over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t attempt to change everything.
Pick an area where a win will be evident and beneficial.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Architecture Decision Record ADR is a compact and traceable documentation of all important decisions taken during the realization of a product.
Use <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">asciidoc</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown/">Markdown</a> and Git to have an agile and lean documentation of your major decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The huge advantage of Architecture Design Record <em>ADR</em> is the timeline of the decisions.
It tremendously helps to understand the technical changes during the product lifecycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please try architecture design records to document your key decisions when developing your software product.
Feel free to identify better approaches</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_definition">Definition</h3>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.
A decision can be documented in an architecture design record (ADR).</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In each ADR file, write these sections:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Title</dt>
<dd>
<p>short present tense imperative phrase, less than 50 characters, like a git commit message.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Status</dt>
<dd>
<p>proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Context</dt>
<dd>
<p>what is the issue that we’re seeing that is motivating this decision or change.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Decision</dt>
<dd>
<p>what is the change that we’re actually proposing or doing.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Consequences</dt>
<dd>
<p>what becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I use asciidoc format to write all our architecture design records.
You can add to the same git repository as the product, visualize differences and if desired generate a nice looking document.
And my IDE IntelliJ IDEA has a nice plugin for this format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before using ADR I documented the decision changes as footnote in a Microsoft Word document.
The ADR approach is way more legible and easier to trace with the help of git repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_title">Title</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These documents have names that are short noun phrases.
For example, &#34;ADR 1: Deployment on Ruby on Rails 3.0.10&#34; or &#34;ADR 9: LDAP for Multiple tenant Integration&#34;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_context">Context</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and product local.
These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such.
The language in this section is value-neutral.
It is simply describing facts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_decision">Decision</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section describes our response to these forces.
It is stated in full sentences, with active voice.
&#34;We will …​&#34;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_status">Status</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A decision may be &#34;proposed&#34; if the product stakeholders haven’t agreed with it yet, or &#34;accepted&#34; once it is agreed.
If a later ADR changes or reverses a decision, it may be marked as &#34;deprecated&#34; or &#34;superseded&#34; with a reference to its replacement(s).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The status and the graph of related decisions can be tracked and visualize using tools.
You can also track your decisions without any tools, a regular product has often less than hundred decisions.
And you can always write a small parse utility to extract your dependency graph.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_consequences">Consequences</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision.
All consequences should be listed here, not just the &#34;positive&#34; ones.
A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and product in the future.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_tips_and_tricks">Tips and Tricks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The whole document describing an ADR should be one or two pages long.
We will write each ADR as if it is a conversation with a future developer.
This requires good writing style, with full sentences organized into paragraphs.
Bullets are acceptable only for visual style, not as an excuse for writing sentence fragments (Bullets kill people, even PowerPoint bullets).</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cost of undocumented decisions is hard to measure, but the effects usually include duplicated efforts.
Other engineers try to solve the same problems or competing solutions (two third-party libraries that do the same thing).</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The approach is very similar to how you would document a software pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Believe and respect is the prime directive.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.</p>

<p>Lately I was asked how many bugs and smells detected through SonarQube were acceptable for a software product.
And a Scrum master inquired which organizational changes are necessary to empower software developers to write good code.
Speechless and dumbfounded, I was unable to answer these questions.</p>

<p>Truly, if the intrinsic quality of the source code is low, it is undeniably a failure.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When there is high pressure on delivery, people have a tendency to pay less attention to processes and standards.

<p>What are the main hurdles to introduce agile approaches in Swiss companies?
The Swiss agile trends report was published for the last ten years and learn us the difficulties and successes of agile transformations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SwissQ has published a &#34;SwissQ Software Development Switzerland 2018&#34;, the tenth version of this report.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Introducing agile company-wide was and is a cultural change process.
Such a change takes time and sometimes hurts.
Too often, organizations stop the process and revert to all command and control approaches with Waterfall product management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without commitment of senior management, the initiative will fail.
In other words <em>Walk the talk</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You must teach, coach, and support your collaborators through the transition.
You need to believe in them and provide an environment where they can safely learn and experiment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end, collaborator purpose, customer satisfaction, and business value matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The study can be downloaded as PDF from their website.
See previous blogs for the results of years 2016, 2013 and 2012.
Below some findings of the study.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_slower_adoption_of_agile_approaches">Slower Adoption of Agile Approaches</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The adoption of agile frameworks has markedly slowed down in Switzerland.
And hybrid methods based on Waterfall methodology are often used.
It is fascinating to see companies trying to merge a linear approach with highly iterative and incremental approaches.
It shall be clear that success will only be elusive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The data of the study reflect this fact through the abysmal collaborator satisfaction with these hybrid approaches (see chapter 13).
Less than 25% of employees are satisfied with the development process of their company.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_major_hurdles_when_introducing_agile_approaches">Major Hurdles When Introducing Agile Approaches</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The list of hurdles for a successful introduction of agile approaches was updated.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">69%</dt>
<dd>
<p>Culture change and you need senior management support</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">54%</dt>
<dd>
<p>Non adapted overall processes because local optimizations have a limited effect</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">42%</dt>

<p>Missing product overview because a company sells products</p>

<p>Missing agile know-how of collaborators and you shall train your collaborators</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We reached a major threshold.
The majority of interviewed companies have more than 500 IT collaborators.
These big companies are struggling to introduce agile approaches company-wide.
Interestingly, 75% of all companies plan to increase investment in the agile introduction and transition projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One interesting consequence is the company compiling the report is actively poaching potential agile candidates from these big laggard companies!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The majority of teams use Scrum or Kanban.
The associated events and tools are used.
Deeper values are often missing.,
Observable examples are test driven development, acceptance test driven development, clean code or refactoring.
The key is:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><em>To be agile, not to do agile</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We wrote in previous blogs that introducing Scrum in the development department or in the whole company is a change process.
The coaches should be trained in change management and have experiences with resistance to changes.
Our experience shows senior management is often not ready to move along the cultural change path.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_sonar">What is Sonar?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> is a central server that processes full analyses (triggered by the various SonarQube Scanners).
Its purpose is to give a 360° vision about the quality of your code base.
For this, it analyzes all the source lines of your product on a regular basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It should be added that SonarQube also performs scans with well-known third party analyzers (<a href="https://spotbugs.github.io/">SpotBugs</a> - previously FindBugs -,
<a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a>, <a href="https://pmd.github.io/">PMD</a>) whereas SonarLint does not include those.
I think the reason is a prioritization on performance and findBugs relying on java byte-code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_sonarlint">What is SonarLint?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SonarLint lives only in your IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse or Visual Studio).
Its purpose is to give instantaneous feedback as you type your code.
For this, it concentrates on what code you are adding or updating.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Findings are displayed in the source code with information such as rule violation, rating of the rule and explanation.
You have a window where all findings are displayed to provide an overview and navigation support.
You are free to analyze a single file, a package, or the whole product; you can also exclude files or packages from the analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Connect SonarLint to your preferred code quality application.
It then uses the same code analyzers, rules and settings locally that are used on the server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Issues marked as Won’t Fix or False Positive in SonarQube or SonarCloud disappear from your IDE.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both SonarLint and SonarQube rely on the same static source code analyzers – most of them being written using SonarSource technology.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_to_use_it">How to use It?</h3>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>the SonarLint in your favorite IDE</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>configure the SonarCube instance to synchronize the rule set used in your product.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the plugin to access your SonarCube instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run it.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>See the messages in the next few seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jump to the source and correct the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterate until all issues are solved.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run your unit tests and acceptance tests – TDD and ATDD -.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commit your changes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach guarantees you always release source code with less SonarCube issues, therefore SonarCube always show no findings for new code and for refactored
code.</p>

<p>As you found out now, I am convinced that <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> approach is one of the best ways to truly transform into an agile organization.
And less truly and deeply advocate technical excellence for all collaborators.
You need an agile mindset and technical excellence to develop awesome products - see <a href="../../2018/pragmatic-craftsmanship">Software Craftsmanship</a> blog.</p>

<p>A huge advantage of <a href="https://less.works">LeSS</a> is that it is <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a>.

<p>The last months I was often confronted with software products having insufficient quality.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Insufficient means late delivery, and few new features.
The effort to correct errors in the field eats <strong>30% to 50%</strong> away from the development budget.
How can such a dreadful situation occur?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One root cause is the low quality of the source code and ignorance of basic coding design approaches.

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why do we define metrics and KPI?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, we want to find out how good the build-in quality of our software artifacts is.
Second, we want to improve the build-in quality through experiments and use the metrics to judge the success of these experiments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the Key Performance Indicators - KPI - provide plausibility checks by qualifying the intrinsic quality of software artifacts against quantifiable strategic objectives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Measurements shall be cheap to gather and as much as possible generated automatically through the tooling landscape.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We provide two sets of measurements to find out how supportive the development process is for quality and how to evaluate the quality of the artifacts.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_definitions">Definitions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A metric is a measure or a combination of measures for quantitatively assessing or improving a product, a process or a team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>key performance indicator</em> is a metric that</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>is tied to a strategic objective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have at least one defined time-bound target value - a number, a trend, a variation, etc. -</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, you must define your strategic objectives before you can use KPIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lean approaches have an imperative to reduce cycle-time, eliminate waste and tend to zero-defect products.
The last one is a corollary because defects are waste. Please use this imperative to define your agile and lean KPIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your tooling landscape does not support automatic gathering of a specific metric, you shall make it optional until you have solved your tooling weaknesses.
Accurate and real-time automated measurements are of tremendous importance for acceptance and lasting success.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_process_aspects">Process Aspects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The optimal lean software development process has a batch size of one, almost no waiting time, no superfluous stock and no quality issues.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This metrics shall be automatically provided through the issue and product backlog system.
For example, the “best of breed” JIRA tool has build-in reports for all the above metrics, so the tools you use should also have them.</p>

<h3 id="_what_has_changed">What has changed?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oracle has decided to release a new JDK two times a year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next release of Java 10 aka 18.3 will be available on March 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JDK 11 aka 18.9 will be released in September 2018.
Java 11 will also be a long-term support <em>LTS</em> release.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_visible_change">The Visible Change</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The visible change is the dawn of the keyword <strong>var</strong>.
Now instead of typing the type declaration of a local variable - local to a method, a block or an instruction - you can just use the keyword var.
The constraint being that the variable is initialized at declaration.
Stay tune for more support in JDK 11.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the type declaration is a complex generic type definition, the var shortcut is a boon.
The code is less verbose and the legibility is at least as good.
When the type is a class name, I got the impression. the benefit is less clear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an exercise, I updated the source code of open source libraries which I have written and the associated tests as in</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first impression is that the new construct sometimes simplifies the code of the library and very often improve the test cases.
Perhaps it takes time until I am accustomed to the new way of writing Java code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_under_the_hood_changes">Under the Hood Changes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The source code of the JDK is consolidated into one repository.
It makes development work more efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The garbage collector shall have a clear and documented API.
Developing and adding new garbage collectors is easier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Various updates such as the Unicode newest version.
The extensions are used in library classes to better support locales.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open JDK and Oracle JDK are slowly merging.
For example, CA certificates will be provided to OpenJDK by Oracle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_outlook">Outlook</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The rhythm of releases is staggering higher.
Starting Spring 2018, we will have * The new rule as blogged by Mark Reinhold <a href="https://mreinhold.org/blog/forward-faster">Moving Java Forward Faster</a>.
* You will get a new JDK every six months * You will get security updates every three months * You will get a long-term support release every three years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means that you shall update your JDK in development environment six times a year if you want to install the new JDK and the security releases.
We recommend automating the process in your environment.
And you shall deliver your applications in Docker containers to support the whole ecosystem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tool landscape is still struggling to adapt to the new rhythm.
I am working with IntelliJ IDE and I had to wait for the EAP 2018.3 before being able to write JDK 10 code in the IDE.
I use Gradle as a building tool and also to wait until JDK 10 was at least partially supported.
And I am still waiting for the update of code coverage plugin.
Before that, I was back to stone age, writing software with a text editor and compiling it with the command line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The library landscape is often behind. They are regularly incompatible with the newest version of the JDK.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JavaFX will be removed from the regular JDK distribution in Fall 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cloud landscape does not support the latest JDK as SAAS.
You must provide your custom docker images with the expected JDK or JRE.
So we are back to IAAS.</p>

During the implementation, they are directly asked for feedback, which then flows into further development steps.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Co-location also means: You are moving.
The teams move into a room and work focused together on their product.
There are no phones, no other projects, and no outside distractions.
They use collaboration tools - chats, wikis, Scrum boards -.
Scrum teams are wholly focused on their product.</p>

<li>
<p>Research and identify viable markets, technologies, and product capabilities.</p>

<p>The essence of Scrum is a small team of people.
The individual team is highly flexible and adaptive.
These strengths continue operating in single, several, and networks of teams.

<p>The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team.
The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint.
At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours.
This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and f<em>orecasting upcoming Sprint work</em>.
The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Updated the Daily Scrum section to provide clarity on the goals of the Daily Scrum including this text</dt>
<dd>
<p>The structure of the meeting is set by the Development Team and can be conducted in different ways if it focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal.
Some Development Teams will use questions, some will be more discussion based. Here is an example of what might be used:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</p>

<p>An increment is a body of inspectable, &#34;Done&#34; work that supports empiricism at the end of the Sprint.
The increment is a step toward a vision or goal.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often, teams discuss if their digital product should upgrade to the current version of open-source or commercial used components.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same discussion arises for development tools and programming language versions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have a <strong>strong opinion</strong> about upgrades.
You should always use the current version of all components included in your product.
The only discussion is the timely <strong>when</strong> and never the <strong>if</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be realist, if your product is successful, you have to upgrade before the components are obsolete.
Otherwise, your application will become a geriatric solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Organizations often forget the liability of using older versions of components with known and published security flaws
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below I provide you with arguments why you should always update all components in a timely fashion.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_security_and_governance">Security and Governance</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Social responsibility and liability considerations require your product to be immune to published attacks.
Your company shall provide reasonable protection to all your customers.
Therefore, you always include security patches in your product in a timely manner.
Other approaches are deeply unprofessional and unethical.
In some countries, you are liable if you do not update your software to avoid known security attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should use actual Java JDK and JVM version because the community is concentrating their effort on the latest version.
Oracle only provides public support for the latest two Java versions, e.g. in January 2018, Java 9 and Java 8 are officially supported.
Java 8 support will stop end of September 2018, older versions are no more publicly maintained.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If, for some reasons, you are using an older commercially but no more publicly supported JDK, you must sign a support contract with the Oracle company and pay for it.
You cannot use deprecated JDK versions because nobody provides security fixes on these versions - e.g. Java 6 commercial support ended in December 2017 –.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you include a deprecated JDK / JVM in your product, you willingly endanger your users and shall be liable for their losses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Governments started to realize how unprofessional organizations are working.
Recommendations and laws are grafted to force better security
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_upgrades_and_genuine_improvements">Upgrades and Genuine Improvements</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The component developers put tremendous effort to improve the non-functional aspects of their products.
Performance and scalability improvements between Java versions are impressive.
You shall not hinder your own customers to rip these low-hanging fruits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actual versions of standards - Unicode, HTTP protocol, time zones - help eliminate incompatibilities and subtle errors from use cases.
Having older versions will hinder you to support actual timezone changes or extensions in the Unicode standard.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_training_and_community_support">Training and Community Support</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good training and associated certification are only available for actual versions of languages, frameworks or library.
You will not find any training for Ada, Apache server 1.x, or any object-oriented database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The articles in Stack Overflow and the community always cover the current version of components.
So you are on your own for support or code examples for older versions of libraries.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_hidden_cost_of_backport">Hidden Cost of Backport</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Writing code for older versions of libraries, frameworks or runtimes means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backporting">backporting</a> to older application interfaces and features.
For example, if you do not have access to auto-closable resources, you have to write your own framework and software checks guarantying closing system resources.
You should always free system resources in your application.
The literature states this is neither easy nor error free.
It is the root reason why such a feature was added to Java.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teams often forget the consequences of back porting.
Later, when you adopt a more modern version of your dependencies, you have to remove all this now spurious code and migrate to the build-in concept.
Otherwise, the code is no more maintainable and changes are error-prone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, you have to twice work when backporting, once to build it in, and a second time to later remove it.
This solution is certainly not the most economical one.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_motivation_of_team">Motivation of Team</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No professional developer wants to write source code using JDK 7 or older versions.
They want to develop using modern and powerful constructs such as lambda, modules, HTTP/2.
I would state that not using such constructs disqualifies you as a professional engineer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We observed how whole teams become demotivated because a huge part of their daily work was backporting to old environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I understand that geriatric software solutions do not allow you to use the latest versions.
It is time to bury such products and to go on.
The only open question is the date of the burial.
Do not wait too long, decomposition is never nice to smell.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maintaining or extending software based on old versions of libraries is just throwing money out the window.
You need a solid basement to build on.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The difficulty with contracts is that it is about trust.
Here lays the roots for success or disaster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If no trust exists, the henceforth dreaded process is established.
After tough negotiations, the development team starts but does not collaborate with the customer.
They just build what is written in outdated requirements.
A subpar solution is shipped and the relationship with the customer is deeply damaged.
We can do better.
We shall collaborate, trust each other and create an awesome product.
This is the essence of <em>being agile</em>.
How shall we be agile and work the lean way in a contractual environment?
By contractual I mean no time and material approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We shall</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define and rapidly realize the minimum viable product <em>MVP</em>.
This product defines success and builds trust.
Use this MVP as anchor during contract negotiation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritize <em>Money, Time, and Scope</em>.
The most important item - and it can only be one - is the basis for the agile contract,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service is the essence of software application development.
So your agile contract shall be a <em>service contract</em>.
Select a rolling contract approach to deeply involve both sides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Fail early and learn</em>.
The disputes between contractors and customers shall stay reasonable due to the smaller amounts in play.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_contract">Contract</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initial success is the timely <em>realization</em> and <em>deployment</em> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>.
The MVP is the anchor of trust.
Use rolling contracts to extend the product.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Priority on Money</dt>
<dd>
<p>Frame cost as investment and discuss value with the customer, not just money.<br/>
<em>Fix the budget - money dimension - and have some tentative milestones.
We must invest to prioritize the stories and talk about your MVP.
Often nice to have functions are never realized.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Priority on Time</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sometimes, it is not about the cost.
Instead, there is a deadline, like the end of the fiscal year.<br/>
<em>Fix the product milestones - time dimension -.
We still must define a budget and prioritize the stories.
The must stories shall be implemented before deadline and budget can be extended to respect the deadline.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Priority on Scope</dt>
<dd>
<p>And in other cases, the scope actually is quite defined, and both money and time are flexible.
In these cases, it makes sense to fix the scope variable.<br/>
<em>Fix the functionality - scope dimension -. Budget overrun and delays are possible.
Defining the scope in advance is less agile.
You assume you already know everything about the product to build.</em></p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The contract defines a service.
The delivered product is the output of the service contract but not the sole item of the contractual binding.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tracking">Tracking</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Signing a contract is the easy part.
Now you must track progress, manage changes, and reach the agreed goals in a timely and economical way.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Commit in trust, training, and decision-making. Train your people and customer’s representatives,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deliver incrementally every few weeks to prove progress and cement trust,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The more trust you build, the less escalation you will have during the product,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have rolling planning, budgeting, and tracking. You shall gain visibility of progress, transparent costs, and tentative end for fulfilling the contract,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you track and document changes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you inform your stakeholders about contract changes?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The later questions are solved differently based on the level of trust between the contractor and the customer.
Try to avoid a full-fledged change management process and systematic escalations.</p>

<p>Finalize the contract,

We suggest sharing the costs and define the percentage each party shall pay, if the supplier pays 0% it is a time and material contract.
If the supplier pays 100% it is a fix price contract. Aim for 50% -,</p>
<div class="ulist">

<p>Define a checkpoint to validate the estimates and hypotheses,</p>

<p>Define exit criteria and exit points for both parties,</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hide the fact you are working the agile way.
Don’t tell the customer you are working any differently to normal.
Clearly state internally why you do it and why your corporate values allow this solution.</p>

<p>Estimate and plan the work as you would normally, sign a perfectly normal contract.
UseAgile techniques and especially <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> to improve delivery.

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most successful projects I worked for had selected the money dimension seen as investment budgets.
Goals correction were communicated early and the contract amended accordingly.
We avoided complicated and expensive change request processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The build products were very successful.
We respected the agreed budget and were timely.
The dynamic was in the scope definition.
We delivered early and often high quality increments so the end users could adjust their expectations and refine their needs.</p>

<p>Agile will never guarantee product success.
All projects, especially application development, entail risk.
If a product was risk-free, it is unlikely to provide significant benefits or competitive advantages.
There are a number of ways in which Agile Scrum projects repeatedly fail which are worth examining.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agile approaches and Scrum framework can reduce risks in projects and increase the return on investment.
<a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/standish-chaos-2015">Standish Group report</a> is a proof of this statement.
One picture shows it all – look at the failed column -</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are common patterns and errors when doing agile instead of being agile</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Wagile</dt>
<dd>
<p>is a team which continues to follow basically a Waterfall product but uses the language of Agile and adds a few agile practices.
For example, the team may present burn-down charts together with Gantt charts.
Or the team computes individual resource allocation for the next three months.
You can also replace Waterfall with V-Model, <a href="http://www.hermes.admin.ch/onlinepublikation/index.xhtml">HERMES</a>, RUP, and even sometimes <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">ScrumBut</dt>
<dd>
<p>describes a team which claims to follow Scrum but misses various practices.
For example, <em>We do Scrum but we don’t have a Product Owner</em>.
Or <em>We do <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> but the Project Manager allocates tasks</em>.
Such teams normally have a long list of “buts” and show little progress of removing them.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Hitting The Scrum Wall</dt>
<dd>
<p>The most popular Agile method is Scrum which is a product management technique.
Scrum is normally used with a number of other Agile techniques, typically user stories redaction and the technical practices from <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> – such as TDD, ATDD, code refactoring, continuous integration and delivery CI/CD, pair programming, etc.
Teams that adopt the Scrum framework initially see an improvement in productivity and customer satisfaction.
Without technical practices, quality is low, and the team hit the wall.
The quality gap makes it impossible to maintain the pace in the long run.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Fake Agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>occurs when a team declares itself Agile and blames everyone else for their failure to interact correctly with the group.
Such a group typically stops writing documentation, listening to business analysts, product managers and other customers, and dictates its own delivery schedule.
Meanwhile, the team does not improve quality, does not adopt test driven development or any other practice they dislike.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Potemkin Agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>occurs when a team adopts and applies an Agile method well but does not deliver business value.
This is a form of goal deferment were the team consider adhering to the process rather than delivering business value as the success criteria.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Customer (Business Analyst, Product Manager, Product Owner) overload</dt>
<dd>
<p>on a well-functioning Agile product the customer, or proxy customer, is called upon to do a lot.
They need to decide requirements, set priorities, scout ahead of the product, align strategy, work with the developers, testers and managers, and may even have their own day job to do.
In the earliest XP product (“C3”) the first business analyst came close to a nervous breakdown.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Fall back</dt>
<dd>
<p>Management may bring in consultants and other experts help switch a team to Agile.
Once the consultants leave some teams return to their old ways of working.
Advisers and consultants can be a great help when introducing Agile.
They need to build capacity in the development team to continue learning and evolving when the consultants are gone.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Failure to go far enough</dt>
<dd>
<p>To maximise the benefits of Agile Software Development the people, processes and organization that interface and work with the Agile team needs to understand Agile and adjust their expectations and working techniques too.
Agile is not a drop-in technology that can be swapped in to replace another failing method.
Isolated Agile teams will find it difficult to be completely Agile.
When other groups adopt agile approaches, the benefits of Agile can spread beyond Software Development.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Exploding cards</dt>
<dd>
<p>happens when teams do not sufficiently understand the technology they are working with – either in the solution or problem domain.
Small work packages suddenly turn out to be large tasks in their own right.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Hyper changing requirements</dt>
<dd>
<p>Most Agile methods, especially Scrum, hold the iteration goals fixed for a few weeks.
An exception is Kanban.
Most businesses should be able to hold to goals for such short periods of time.
If it proves impossible to hold requirements and goals fixed for even one week, then something is wrong.
In a few cases, business is genuinely changing extremely rapidly.
In this case, teams are better off using Kanban style management than a Scrum-based approach.
More often, hyper change in goals and requirements are a sign that something is wrong beyond the team.
The organization itself may lack strategy and objectives, or the Product Owner may not be filling their role adequately.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Fragile, not Agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>Some Agile techniques, like TDD, ATDD, CI or CD, when poorly applied with a lack of understanding can show short-term benefits but create long-term problems.</p>
</dd>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coaching means that an experienced coach will work closely together with an organization to improve the organization’s product development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This usually involved shortening feedback loops and focusing on improved quality.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You use <em>Minimum Viable Change</em> (MVC).
So I am using yet another acronym.
Each MVC has a hypothesis about how to improve an aspect of your organization or your team.
It has measurements – often called KPI by management – to decide if the change was a worthy improvement.
For the savvy readers, it is a variant of PDCA, a cornerstone of all agile and lean approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our core strength at <a href="https://www.tangly.net/">tangly</a> is we truly understand software technology and software craftsmen.
We consistently connect organizational MVC with technical MVC.
This is our special recipe for deep-rooted and lasting success.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is time to throw a big party in Switzerland.
More than 60% of all projects are now realised using an agile approach (to see Agile Trends in Switzerland 2017] by
<a href="http://swissq.it/en/agile/">SwissQ</a>), Scrum being the most popular one, Kanban as the second one.
What a change in just one year.
In 2016, we had 40% of projects being agile, one year later we have 60%.
<em>Time to adapt and become agile</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was a long journey.
At the beginning of this millennium, I was convincing managers that agile is not evil and could be used in Switzerland.
Yes, agile is compatible with Swiss culture - we finally added <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> to the national methodology
<a href="http://www.hermes.admin.ch/onlinepublikation/index.xhtml?element=supportingmaterial_hinweis_agiles_projektmanagement_mit_hermes_und_scrum.html">Hermes</a> -.
The report 2016 patently states that agile projects are more successful for the customer and the company than non-agile ones.
It is genuinely time to adapt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See our previous blogs for the results of <a href="../../2017/agile-trends-switzerland-2016">Agile Trends Switzerland 2012</a>,
<a href="../../2016/agile-trends-switzerland-2012">Agile Trends Switzerland 2012</a>, and <a href="../../2016/agile-trends-switzerland-2013">Agile Trends Switzerland 2013</a>.
They illustrate the slow gains of agile and lean approaches in our country.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have a strong <em>déjà-vu</em>.
I am now convincing managers that agile approaches for the whole company are not evil and could be used in Europe and Switzerland.
Yes, agile approaches are compatible with European and Swiss cultures.
Yes, holistic agile approaches increase the odds of success to deliver tremendous products to our customers.
Again, I heard the same arguments as 15 years ago why our companies are different and need special approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To ripe the benefits of agile approaches, it is now time to transition whole departments and the company.
I hope to succeed in the first half of this century.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below some findings of the study.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_major_hurdles_introducing_agile_approaches">Major Hurdles Introducing Agile Approaches</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The major hurdles when introducing agile approaches at department/company level are</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Current company culture</dt>
<dd>
<p><a href="http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior">First change the structure</a>, it enables
<a href="http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior">cultural change</a>.
Quite a few companies try to change their culture without altering their structure.
It is doomed to fail.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Existing company structure and frozen hierarchies</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is time to rethink your structure and move decision power to the teams, near to the customers,</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Controlling not tailored to agile approaches</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is difficult to be slightly agile.
The same can be said about lean.
Either you are lean, agile or you are not.
Try <a href="http://bbrt.org/">Beyond Budgeting Round Table</a>,</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Overall processes are not tailored to agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once you change your structure and hierarchy, the processes will evolve.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Trust is missing</dt>
<dd>
<p>Here again we talk again about trust, or the beliefs your collaborators are competent and do their best to achieve success.
As an organization and as a manager, it is time to decide.
Do you truly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_Theory_Y">trust</a> your collaborators?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Customers are not involved or engaged</dt>
<dd>
<p>Customers are the center in the new world.
Please involve them, talk to them, find out what they need</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could also say organizations are still struggling with <em>Being agile, not doing agile</em>.
Avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_our_recommendations">Our Recommendations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You shall start introducing agile approaches at department and company level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Senior management is fully committed to the approach and approves the cultural change.
Read the book &#34;Reinventing Organizations&#34; from Frederic Laloux to understand the implied changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Train your managers to understand agile, lean, and customer-centric approaches.
Training is not a half-day introduction, it is days and days of training, workshops, and reading.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transition is painful, see the seminal articles of Steve Denning</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The principles are</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Products are value-driven and quality oriented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams are focused to master their work and tools - Craftsmanship, <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For huge development departments consider using the <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams work best if you can answer with a deafening yes to these five questions.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Psychological safety: Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependability: Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structure &amp; clarity: Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meaning of work: Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impact of work: Do we fundamentally believe that the work we are doing matters?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have doubts, please refrain from using agile and lean methods.
Introducing agile approaches in product development is similar to introducing lean principles in a production environment.
Either you do it fully or the benefits are marginal.
Worst the best employees will see through and probably leave due to unkept promises.</p>

Introducing agile approaches in product development is similar to introducing lean principles in a production environment.
Either you do it fully or the benefits are marginal.</p>

Scrum teams try to be fully cross-functional and invest a lot of effort to reach this goal.
They probably do it because it is written in all Scrum tutorials.
Every person should be able to take a task from the Scrum board and implement it.

Scrum is about agility.
Therefore, you have the right to change anything at any time, isn’t it?
Your stakeholders need the changes now.
They cannot wait until the end of the sprint, a mere ten working days or two weeks of elapsed time.
But Scrum also states we have a vision, features, a minimum viable product and a potentially shippable product.
How often can you change these key concepts?
What is the balance between agility and chaos?</p>

So teams state that - No architecture is needed before starting coding, - No enterprise architecture should be defined or look at, - No non-functional considerations are needed.
Look at the picture.
Could you design a village without knowing about the ground, the kind of population, do you need school, do they have a flood in the area?
They believe that refactoring will solve all the problems.
Architects are no more needed, we are all talented hackers.</p>

<p>What is the risk?</p>

<p>The truth is complex, more blurred.
The answer for your product cannot be stated in one standard rule set.
We are talking about agile quality assurance, lean approaches and the best practices.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Best practice should only be selected through its ROI.</p>

Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value,

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I often hear discussions asking who is performing the <em>traditional</em> product leader tasks in Scrum.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is in general an excuse to state that <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> alone cannot work and classical product leaders are still needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I encourage you to classify these so-called regular product manager activities.
Often these jobs are plain reporting progress to various boards and micromanaging the development team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I truly acknowledge the importance and value of a line manager caring for his collaborators and nurturing the success of the products they develop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But to be honest, these activities are implemented by good people and technical leaders and almost never by some product managers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below a list of tasks you do <strong>NOT</strong> need anymore to do in <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make commitments on behalf of the team about how much they can get done by a certain date or estimate effort for the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coerce the team that the commitments made on their behalf are attainable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coerce the team to change their estimates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give direction to the team on how to implement the work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor the team’s progress to make sure they stay on schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step in and determine the solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct weekly status update and face to face meetings with the team to surface issues and provide direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide motivation and push the team to work harder than they might want to use carrots and sticks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decide task assignments among the team members and follow up on tasks to verify completion.
Force them to work during weekends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be responsible for the team doing the right thing at the right time in the right way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update Gantt charts for the iteration and release planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding out those requirements means to explain to team members what they should implement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review the documents and code to guaranty quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain upper management why the product is late and why you need additional resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain upper management why you cannot transfer a team member to another product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attend weekly progress and escalation meetings to explain in detail the status of your product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define the priority of the next activities.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above Scrum anti-patterns picture shows more common misunderstandings about the Scrum framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a Scrum practitioner, you should regularly read material, attend formal trainings, and seek advanced certifications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You as Scrum master or agile product manager have to perform important and useful tasks:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Help to remove impediments to increase the velocity of a team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coach team to implement Scrum and reflect on their activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA/">Plan-Do-Check-Adapt</a> <em>Plan Do Check Act</em> principle is built into Scrum with retrospectives and sprint reviews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coach product owner to deliver a groomed and refined backlog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform and support all product’s stakeholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you reflect on these two lists it becomes obvious that the first list describes malfunctions and the second one describes mechanisms how to improve continuously - lean principles -.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Sutherland">Jeff Sutherland</a> gives some interesting insights about the Scrum master</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Scrum master enforces Scrum practices <em>Coaching rather than command and control</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Scrum master effort is</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Few problems: for a small team 10%, for a large team, 50% of your working time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many problems: for a small team 50%, for a large team, 100% of your working time until the team reaches flow status</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Scrum master is a change agent and supports the organization to become more agile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I experimented with the Scrum master being part of the team, or Scrum master working for multiple teams.
Experience has shown us that the full-time Scrum master is more effective.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I left the company I founded 20 years ago and needed a new home to work and have access to social insurance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best legal construct in Switzerland and in Europe is to establish a limited liability company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need such a construct in Switzerland to work as a software specialist.
The legal Swiss institutions, such as taxes, social insurances, and accident insurances are challenging and almost unfair with freelancers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had to found a limited liability company with a capital of CHF 20&#39;000.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here the steps for the impatient.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_foundation">Foundation</h3>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.swissregistration.ch/">Swissregistration</a> wrote the statutes for the company and performed the foundation with certifying notary for CHF 780.
Six hours after the first phone call they sent me the electronic documents.
The next day, the documents were delivered in paper form.
It was really impressive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before you can find a company you must deposit the capital into a special account.
I choose <a href="https://www.postfinance.ch/">Postfinance</a>.
It is a well-known Swiss institute and their fee is only CHF 145.
They insisted I met one of their collaborators to fill their forms – probably never heard about web forms -.
I had bad luck.
They needed three weeks to create the account and send payment confirmation.
They were aware of the problem and very helpful, but it still took three weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon reception of the payment confirmation, I sent all signed documents to <a href="https://www.swissregistration.ch/">Swissregistration</a>.
The next day the company was founded, and I received the official paper documents a few hours later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I went to <a href="https://www.zg.ch/behoerden/volkswirtschaftsdirektion/handelsregisteramt">Handelsregisteramt Zug</a> to register the company.
They were very nice but told me they had a lot of work.
Two weeks later, they finally registered the company and sent me the papers and an invoice of CHF 780.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few phone calls later <a href="http://www.postfinance.ch/">Postfinance</a> converted the account into a regular account.
They give me access to the founding capital minus their fee</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the waiting time, I started to organise for the mandatory insurances you need in Switzerland</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>BVG – the best offer was from <a href="https://www.axa-winterthur.ch/">Axa Winthertur</a>.
They also help me because the company CRIF AG wrongly classified the activities of the new company.
They never contacted me and their NOGA classification has a huge impact on my costs.
They are arrogant morons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BU/NBU – the best offer was from <a href="https://www.baloise.ch/">Basler Versicherung</a>
When starting a software startup I suggest not concluding any other insurances</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The government controlled social insurance contracts can only be initiated once the company is registered in the Swiss company registry.
The AHV center needed more than two weeks to confirm my registration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lessons_learnt">Lessons Learnt</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The costs of founding my limited company in Switzerland are CHF 1&#39;705 or 8.5% of the capital of the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state-owned companies and state services are very slow; in my case 20 times slower than the private ones.
On the bright side, their collaborators are very supportive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public or big private companies, such as insurance firms, are incapable of sending documents or invoices electronically.
They only use paper mail.
Upon inquiry, their collaborators told me their processes are incapable of handling modern communication ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon foundation, you get pseudo-official letters from various companies to sell dubious services.
Just throw them away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The industry development office of Kanton Zug has no clues about start-up companies; the ones in Zürich and Luzern seem better.</p>

<p>Lately, people often ask me what is an agile company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They have an understanding of agile software development techniques such as <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development/">Lean Software Development</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban/">Kanban</a>, <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> but no clue how a company could be agile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way to approach this theme is to implement concepts of the above-mentioned agile approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are the pillars for iterative incremental improvements.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scrum_pillars">Scrum Pillars</h3>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Transparency</dt>
<dd>
<p>You trust all collaborators to provide their best when working on the product.
They need full access to all relevant information: quality, progress, budget, people and financial data.
They use the data to select the best alternatives to reach the company’s goals.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Inspection</dt>
<dd>
<p>You cherish a failure culture because inspections will find weak points.
You need a culture where people are never blamed.
One consequence is that you eliminate management by objectives, and bonuses in your company.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Adaptation</dt>
<dd>
<p>You are ready to learn better approaches and truly believe there is a better solution.
Processes change regularly bottom-up, company’s budget can only be a rolling indicative budget, and planning has to be <em>continuously</em> updated.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also pursue desirable attitudes or values of agile persons.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scrum_values">Scrum Values</h3>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Commitment</dt>
<dd>
<p>As an employee you want to win, you are engaged.
Every manager truly believes you work best to achieve the goals.
If not, this manager made a mistake by hiring or keeping you.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Courage</dt>
<dd>
<p>You are ready to say “I am wrong” because being wrong opens the door for improvement.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Focus</dt>
<dd>
<p>You daily optimise the customers’ value and thrive for excellence.
As a developer, you do not work on projects, you work on excellent products.
You provide value to your customers.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Openness</dt>
<dd>
<p>You seek better ideas and ways of doing.
Openness requires transparency and respect.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Respect</dt>
<dd>
<p>You truly respect customers, team members, collaborators, and people.
In your team, I will not hear any disrespectful comments about people.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">Make people awesome</dt>
<dd>
<p>Dedicated collaborators want to give their best.
Give them a purpose, a goal, empower them and let them climb the mountain.
Thriving people need purpose, excellence and autonomy.
They are happier, healthier and more productive.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Deliver value continuously</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maintain sustainable pace and stability, all divisions of the organisation should focus on customer value.
At the end of the day, successful products are the only reason you get your paycheck.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Make safety a prerequisite</dt>
<dd>
<p>People do their best in their daily work, you believe in McGregor Y theory.
Trust them and support them to become excellent.
You shall develop self-awareness to increase safety.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Experiment and learn rapidly</dt>
<dd>
<p>You make mistakes, you learn and increase continuously the delivered value.
You have a learning culture, you inspect and adapt.
You can react to new opportunities faster than competitors.</p>

<p>The above concepts are comprehensible.
How do you know if you are moving in the right direction?
A few concrete tests help you find out if you are an agile department or company.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Be agile</em> instead of <em>do agile</em>.
Practice the above attitudes and do not just follow a checklist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nobody micromanages in your company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Feel accountable</em> instead of <em>being accountable</em>.
You want to improve, and your company as a natural part of the daily work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Compliment every collaborator</em> you are working with at least once a week instead of <em>evaluating weaknesses and criticising people</em>.
Do you lead by example?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No management by objectives - MBO - or bonuses are established in your company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every collaborator has access to all company data, every collaborator can request process and tool changes.
We favour <em>Individuals and interactions over tools and processes</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to be excellent in your work.
You have a purpose and autonomy in your daily work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team members take the decision to hire or to fire collaborators, not the department responsible or the human resources group.
Think about collaborators selecting their leaders, about managers being servants, about information available to all collaborators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you say these essential sentences at least three times a week?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the most important one word, <em>Sorry.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the most important two words, <em>Thank you.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the most important three words, <em>I was wrong.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the most important four words, <em>Can I help you?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I truly believe that we all want a fulfilling job which improves our world.
I cannot understand other reasons to spend 40 hours and more per week for something less valuable.
Take the above principles and apply them to your daily work.
There are universal values to establish a working atmosphere you are proud of.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>I agree with all of you to desire a fulfilling job is only true if you earn enough money to pay your monthly bills.</em></p>

<p>The described approach is optimal for small teams.
The approach is compatible to pull requests if you introduce such a workflow later.
You do not need to pull requests when you are working collocated.
I prefer pair programming and pair check-in sessions against the trunk.</p>

Ken and Jeff have a clear idea who is in charge of this.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum Master is a main driver for the introduction of Scrum in all departments and levels in the company.

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Finding</em> techniques for effective Product Backlog management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Clearly, communicating vision</em>, goals, and Product Backlog items to the Development Team;.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum Master should also coach the product owner and support him in the long term planning, the communication of the vision and backlog management.
The vision and goals of the product should always contain an overall planning frame. During the product empirical evidence will trigger revision of the
milestones and product planning.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_the_meaning_of_done_and_a_piece_of_potentially_shippable_product">What is the meaning of done and a piece of potentially shippable product?</h3>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as “Done”, everyone must understand what “Done” means.
Although this varies significantly per Scrum Team, members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure transparency.
This is the <em>Definition of Done</em> for the Scrum Team and is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Development Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint.
This Increment is working product, so a Product Owner may choose to immediately release it.
Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly tested, ensuring that all Increments work together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their <em>Definition of Done</em> will expand to include more stringent criteria for higher quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints.
At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be ““Done””, which means it must be in usable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s Definition of “Done”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>It must be in useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to actually release it.</em></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So at the end of sprint all stories realized since the start of the product must be correct.
Therefore you need automated acceptance tests to guaranty their correctness.
The Scrum team must guaranty that at the end of each sprint all functions of the product work as specified and accepted by the product owner in the current and previous sprint reviews.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Higher quality is reached through extreme programming approach: test driven development, clean code, pair programming, pair check-in, coding dojo, static analysis tools.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_does_scrum_consider_long_term_planning">Does Scrum consider long-term planning?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes it is a major activity performed by the Scrum Master and Product Owner. See the above point about the Scrum Master coaching the Product Owner.
See if anyone states that long-term planning is not part of the Scrum theory you should challenge them and give them the Scrum Guide to read.
What can be changed during a Sprint? Often customers have heated discussions what can be changed during a sprint. Here a clear statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the Sprint:
* No changes are made that would affect the Sprint Goal;
* Development Team composition and quality goals remain constant; and,
* Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_measured_in_a_burn_down_chart">What is measured in a burn down chart?</h3>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrum does not consider the time spent working on Sprint Backlog Items.
The work remaining and date are the only variables of interest.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only relevant information is the amount of work still open and when this work will be completed.
This is true for sprint, release and whole backlog burn-down chart.
I am glad that these precisions were added to the new version of the Scrum guide.
I simplify my daily work.
I can now simply refer the official Scrum Guide to convince people how aspects of Scrum should be understood.
The older version of the Scrum Guide is still relevant because it contains hints and best practices no more part of the new version.</p>

<p>I am often told that it is difficult to use Agile/Scrum approaches for brown field projects or for big projects or for distributed projects or for in other situations.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interestingly, these people also state that the same problems exist with traditional approaches such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenUP">RUP/OpenUP</a>,

<p>I learnt quite a few new acronyms and techniques when studying for the PMI-ACP certification program.
In this post I collected these acronyms, some definition and the bibliography you should know before attending the examination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main advantage of having it is that you no longer need to argue with PMI certified product managers if agile is applicable to software projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main interest of PMI-ACP certification is their collection of concepts taken from Agile, eXtreme Programming, Scrum and Lean.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It could be worth your money to buy the book &#34;The PMI-ACP Exam: How to pass on Your First Try&#34;, Andy Crowe, First Edition 2012.
The book itself is not rocket science, but it contains two hundred questions which are similar to the ones you will encounter during the examination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get your 21 PDUs necessary for the examination you must attend a training course.
I booked an online course at Simplilearn for a reasonable price.
The content was reasonable.
The test questions were good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The renewal of the certification again requires PDUs.
I took online training in interesting areas such as coaching techniques, how to manage effective and efficient meetings or how to write good protocols.
Some online videos of <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog">Mike Cohn</a> also count for PDUs.</p>

each iteration? <em>Workload Management</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of the following technique can be used to apply to bring down the Lost Opportunity Cost within your team? <em>Team Collocation</em></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Who is the most appropriate person to monitor all the risks in an Agile product? <em>The product manager</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of the following is false about Velocity? <em>Velocity cannot correct Estimation errors</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of the following is NOT the skill for Agile coaches for facilitating change? <em>Reaching agreement</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which tool combines the estimation techniques of expert opinion, disaggregation and analogy?
<em>Planning poker combines expert opinion, analogy, and disaggregation into an enjoyable approach to estimating that results in quick but reliable estimates.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of the following metrics can be BEST standardized across teams?
<em>Business case realization -The PMO can help the teams to enable timely decision making by standardizing the metrics.-</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which is the communication technique where you repeat back a summary of what the other person just said to you to confirm understanding?
<em>Reflective Listening is a communication technique where you repeat back a summary of what the other person just said to you to confirm understanding.</em>
<em>Another benefit in this situation is that having the person hear their own ideas in another person’s voice/words may make it easier for them to be objective.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adaptation depends upon understanding a wide range of information, including an assessment of the product’s progress, technical risks, the requirements
evolution, and ongoing competitive market analysis. Which are the areas where every team needs to constantly evaluate and make appropriate adaptations?
<em>Product Value, Product quality, Product status, Team performance -Every team needs to constantly evaluate and make appropriate adaptations in the following four areas - Product Value, Product quality, Product status, Team performance-</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A standard for measuring or evaluating something. <em>Metric - A metric is a standard for measuring or evaluating something.-</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What BEST describes the characteristics of a Learner at Level 3 or in the Fluent stage of learning?
Learners in the Fluent stage are experts -The Stage 3 Learner is at the stage of mastery.
He is able to figure out the end effect of any procedure and to make his way to that end.-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scrum uses the sashimi technique to require that every slice of functionality created by the developers be complete.
All the requirements gathering and analysis, design work, coding, testing, and documentation that constitute a complete product are required to be completed
in every Sprint and demonstrated in the Sprint increment of functionality. Sprints are kept short enough that the stakeholders don’t lose interest in the
product before the Sprints are completed. And stakeholders can see that they have an opportunity to redirect the product at the start of every Sprint to
optimize the value they derive from the product. At the end of every Sprint, stakeholders see new functionality. Models, requirements, and internal
artefacts might be of use to the developers, but they are never shown to the stakeholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feature X has a value of 12 and the total value of all features is 35. If the feature is estimated to cost 56%, what is the priority of this feature using
relative weighting?
<em>Correct Answer is B. The priority of the feature is determined by dividing the relative value by the cost %. Hence the answer = (12/35)/(0.56) = 0.61.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 100-Point Method was originally developed by Dean Leffingwell and Don Widrig for use cases and is used for prioritization as well.
It is a voting scheme where each stakeholder is given 100 points that he or she can use for voting in favour of the most important requirements.
How they distribute the 100 points is up to them: 20 here, 10 there or even all 100 on a single requirement if that is their sole priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a team member approaches the Coach with a complaint about another team member, what conflict resolution technique should the Coach use?
<em>Three-step intervention path</em>
Every team needs to constantly evaluate and make appropriate adaptations in the following four areas: Product value, Product quality, Team performance,
Project status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Normative methodologies are based on solutions or sequences of steps known to work for the discipline.
Electrical and other building codes in house wiring are examples.
In software development, one would include state diagram verification in this category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterative development means that we build a partial version of a product and then expand that version through successive short time periods of development
followed by reviews and adaptations. Feature-based delivery means that the engineering team builds features of the final product or, particularly with
industrial products. At least a close representation of the final product (such as a simulation model). Iterations are constrained to produce a result within
a certain period of time—a time box (as short as 1–4 weeks for software). Time boxes force closure; they force us to make something concrete, often before
we are quite ready. Incremental development means that we build these products such that they could be deployed at the end of one or more of the iterations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forecasting the financial value of a theme is the responsibility of the product owner, but it is a responsibility shared with all other team
members—programmers, testers, analysts, product managers, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decision Framing focuses majorly on,
<em>Decision framing focuses on who gets involved in the decision process.</em>
<em>Managers who make decisions without input from subordinates and peers make poor decisions.</em>
<em>Engineers who make decisions without input from managers and peers make poor decisions.</em>
<em>Who makes the decision is less important than getting the right people involved in the decision process.</em></p>
</li>

<p>Which of the following charts shows the total number of story points completed through the end of each iteration? <em>Cumulative story point burn-down chart</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During a critical problem-solving, you can ask probing questions, use active and reflective listening, Lead to an answer, but one should avoid injecting their
own ideas.</p>

<p>The trend is a clear move toward agile approaches.
Companies seem less reluctant to introduce agile approaches.
Major opponents such as senior managers or internal and external customers more and more acknowledge the success of agile approaches.
The two first identified hurdles still reflect the difficulty of changes at company level.
They are also the main reasons why a Scrum introduction fails in Swiss companies for my experience.
Too often, companies revert to some Waterfall/Hermes process or worst to a so-called internal ad-hoc method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We wrote in previous blogs that introducing Scrum in the development department or in the whole company is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management">change process</a>.
The coaches should be trained in change management and have experiences with resistance to changes.</p>

<p>The Scrum Master is of tremendous importance.
You need a skilled and enthusiastic Scrum Master; avoid Scrum Administrator.
Ken and Jeff have a clear idea who is in charge of this.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We wrote on blogs that introducing Scrum in the development department or in the whole company is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management">change process</a>.
The coaches should be trained in change management and have experiences with resistance to changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above points in italics are all related to changing processes.
You can handle two thirds of the hurdles with adequate change management training and a clear change product definition.
Do not try to introduce Scrum at company level without such an approach.</p>

<p>We wrote in previous <a href="../../2016/scrum-master-is-a-full-time-role">Scrum master is a full time job</a> that the Scrum Master is of tremendous importance.
You need a skilled and enthusiastic Scrum Master; avoid Scrum Administrator.
The new version of the Scrum guide clearly stated who is responsible for the introduction of the Scrum approach in the company?
Often people state that the management should spread Scrum in the company. Ken and Jeff have a clear idea who is in charge of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Leading</strong> and <strong>coaching</strong> the organization in its Scrum adoption;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Planning</strong> Scrum implementations within the organization;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team; and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Working</strong> with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the Scrum Master is a main driver for the introduction of Scrum in all departments and levels in the company.
He needs senior management support, but the Scrum Master’s daily job is to spread Scrum in the company.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Does the approach really promote team work?</p>

<p>Well, my current experience is that the answer is a sounding <strong>YES</strong>.</p>

<p>Developers love to develop software products using <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a>.
The motivation and positive energy just explode.</p>

<p>Stakeholders and customers or users embrace the advantages they get.</p>

<p><em>Yes, it is not without consequences for the organization</em>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Say your team is developing software products with <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a>.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stakeholders love Scrum.
Every two weeks they have a new application version they can use, test, and get feedback from all users.
This is the dream of every key account manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because a new release is available every two weeks, the stakeholders should also provide feedback every two weeks.
They sometimes hate the pressure of agile and Scrum.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agile methods - Scrum, XP - are fun for all developers.
Suddenly, everyone can see your code, so at the beginning you as a developer must cope with different views how good code should be written.
Suddenly, you must master Test Driven Development TDD, mocking, unit test, legible documents.
But, once you have it, you start to experience the &#34;flow&#34; and enjoy the atmosphere and to deliver at the end of each sprint a new software artifact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later, you realize that Scrum says the team is responsible.
You must acknowledge that product success is also your success.
Each design decision is now also driven by ROI considerations.
If you master these responsibilities, you suddenly discover the world of engineering.
It is creating great products with an optimal balance of external quality and costs without ever jeopardizing the quality of the core.
You can never again deny that you as a developer are in charge.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scrum_master">Scrum Master</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum master [<a href="#mastering-professional-scrum">1</a>] is cool with a team enjoying Scrum and the flow of success.
You just have to realize you are not a master but the enabler of a team of talented engineers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So you need to discover your <em>the lonely cowboy riding in the sun</em> song why this job is so rewarding.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_product_owner">Product Owner</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a product owner [<a href="#professional-product-owner">2</a>], you control the budget of the product, the priorities.
At the end of each iteration you can change all priorities and goals.
Cool isn’t it.
But wait as a product owner, I am responsible for the budget and product success and each time a member of the team asks me something I must have an answer ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrum is cool and we enjoy it.
And Scrum makes everything transparent and fast.
Every two weeks, a new version is delivered.
This version must be evaluated, accepted or a list of improvements must be provided in the next few days.
This rhythm is fast, really fast.
Once you are up to this speed, you will enjoy the flow.</p>

<p>Middle management often struggles with the agile approach at the beginning.
See for example the discussion about <a href="https://less.works/less/management/index.html">manager role in an agile environment</a> in the <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> approach.
Be assured the results are worth the effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reading experience report or digging in the findings of Kotter, you realize success or failure goes through how you handle middle management.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> and agile mantra is to have a <em>ready to ship</em> product each time a sprint is completed.
You must avoid any incomplete activities at any price.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Incomplete activities are also called <em>Undone Work</em>.
They are technical debts in your software, hindering its delivery to users.
They are expended money you cannot invoice to your customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regulatory and traditional quality insurance departments request all kinds of documents, such as review, test results, risk analysis matrix.
They want insurance that their view of quality is fulfilled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrum sees the importance of quality like the lean production approach [<a href="#scrum-pocket-guide-3rd">1</a>].
Quality is built into the product.
You do not need any documents proving you have fulfilled this goal.
Your sole goal is to optimize the process to produce the best products, not to repair them after production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is the sole responsibility of the Scrum team to guaranty the quality of their product [<a href="#mastering-professional-scrum">2</a>].
Scrum teams also learnt you cannot win against big corporations.
So you have to define solutions satisfying the QA departments with minimal overhead and almost no undone work.
We have experience working with quality insurance and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technischer_%C3%9Cberwachungsverein">TUV</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration">FDA</a> driven regulatory departments.
We use the following approaches to handle the needs of the regulatory departments, seen as stakeholders in the Scrum terminology.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use static analysis tools such as <a href="https://pmd.github.io/">PMD</a>, <a href="https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/">Checkstyle</a>, <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/">Findbugs</a>
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> to create quality gate reports for your QA department.
Thousands of checks and hundreds of pages of reports will satisfy any QA department.
Plugins exist for <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> and continuous integration servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use review plugin such as Eclipse Jupiter to create these still mandatory review reports on the source code.
These reports are useless in an agile team working with techniques such as refactoring and pair programming.
But they are still mandatory for most of traditional quality assurance <em>QA</em> departments.
The plugin allows you to generate nice looking reports and to implement the findings at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> approach and create a lot of unit tests.
By slightly extending the logging features of JUnit and by using code coverage tools you can create reports showing which source code was tested.
Add some annotations to your test cases, and you have full traceability to your stories and associated software requirements.
With a small amount of work you can generate thousands of pages of information and provide the PDF documents to the regulatory department.
These documents are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technischer_%C3%9Cberwachungsverein">TUV</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration">FDA</a> compliant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">Behavior Driven Development</a> approach and create acceptance criteria for all your stories.
Using the reporting features of <a href="https://easyb.io/">easyb</a>, you can create acceptance test reports for all your stories.
It generates hundreds of pages of information and provides the PDF documents to the regulatory department.
These documents are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technischer_%C3%9Cberwachungsverein">TUV</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration">FDA</a> compliant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use continuous integration servers to run all the above measures and generate the documentation at the end of each sprint or release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Link you version control system with your continuous server, issue tracking system and unit tests.
So you can generate release notes stating the list of closed issues with the associated source code and unit tests verifying the correctness of the change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar tools are available in Python .NET, or C++ communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can easily satisfy your QA and regulatory stakeholders with a lot of reports nobody will ever read.
A real <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> team corrects weaknesses during the development process and always deliver software of the highest quality.
The reports can only show the inherent quality of the software and are not worth the paper they are printed on.
But you satisfy powerful stakeholder groups and can more freely work on the most important goal.
Deliver on time and in budget the best software the customer wants to have.</p>
