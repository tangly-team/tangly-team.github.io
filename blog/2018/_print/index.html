<p>It is official.
The power engine of SAFe 4.6 vehicle is team and technical agility.
View the <a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/whats-new-in-safe-46/">official presentation</a> and more important download the
<a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/whats-new-in-safe-46">slides</a>.
It is one of their five Lean Enterprise competencies and one of their four core values.
SAFe finally recognizes the tremendous importance of <a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/team-and-technical-agility/">technical proficiency and craftsmanship</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They advocate two findings.
First, you need team agility, how you apply Scrum or Kanban.
In other words <em>being agile instead of doing agile</em>.
Second, you need technical agility, how you develop a quality product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I challenge you.
If you are following <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a>, talk with your teams and checks how many of their official good practices are you using on a daily basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have seen <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> introductions in Swiss, German and Czech companies.
Attention was set on the structure of the release train and a lot of effort was spent on the various ceremonies, meetings and artifacts.
But how to produce quality software and apply technical excellence was sadly always an afterthought.
And more than once a senior <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> coach just publicly stated that the <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> core value x is not so important for a successful introduction.
Quite a denial approach of his own methodology I think!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be honest with yourself and your teams, either you implement the techniques described in <a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework" class="bare">https://v46.scaledagileframework</a>
.com/team-and-technical-agility/[Technical Agility] and <a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/built-In-quality/">Build-In Quality</a> chapters of <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> or you are
not agile and have no <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> power engine.
It is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">cargo cult</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good starting point are the five dimensions of build-in quality described in <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> 4.6.
And yes now <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> acknowledged the tremendous importance of a
<a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/continuous-delivery-pipeline/">continuous delivery pipeline</a>.
Experts agree you can apply DevOps only if you have continuous integration, delivery and deployment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you realize where your organization stands remember that build-in quality is one of tour core values of <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a>.
That I mean is walk the talk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And please read some Internet blogs and books about <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship">Software Craftsmanship</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">Extreme Programming</a>, TDD, ATTD, clean code.
Most of these concepts were defined and published in the last millennium.
It is time your teams finally adopt them and produce high quality, maintainable and cost-effective products.
This is the whole concept of the lean movement.
And I welcome the fact that <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> now explicitly mention <a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/built-in-quality/">Cost of Delay</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the strengths of <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> is their clear statement that an agile organization transformation is only successful with lean-agile leadership.
All C-level managers are trained in lean and agile, they advocates these approaches and are visible champions.
Therefore all managers shall be advocate technical excellence on a daily basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If not the seminal work of John Kotter clearly states the transformation will fail.
You will have a bunch of Scrum teams in your development department, but have none of the expected synergies at product or company level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Personally I prefer the <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> approach, but I respect your choice - <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a>,
<a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/nexus-guide">Nexus</a>, or <a href="https://www.scrumatscale.com/scrum-at-scale-guide/">Scrum@Scale</a> - as long as technical excellence is
a key aspect of your agile strategy.
Embrace technical agility and do not let your train of teams produce mediocre software every two weeks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Employ professional software craftsmen and deliver quality products.
Follow your <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> approach, respect one of the <a href="https://v46.scaledagileframework.com/safe-core-values/">four core values</a> and one of the
<a href="https://v46\.scaledagileframework.com/">five core competencies</a> of your method.</p>

<p>The other big improvement is that the PI horizon is now <em>limited</em> to 8 or 12 weeks.
No more semesterly or hopefully quarterly cadence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It still does no make sense to plan for three months and at the same time advocate DevOps and design thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DevOps has a time horizon of days, it is waste to have huge quarterly PI gatherings and plans just to discard them after the next DevOps finding.
You should probably just update your PI roadmap.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_call_for_action">Call for Action</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My call for action is fewer meetings and paper artifacts and more technical excellence.
You want to sell excellent and well-designed products, not mediocre software.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><em>Did we build it right?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://less.works/less/framework/definition-of-done.html">Definition of Done</a> <em>DoD</em> is a major building block to answer this question with a sounding <strong>yes</strong>.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_definition_of_done">Definition of Done</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum</a> and <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> have a stringent discussion concerning <em>Definition of Done</em>.
The key question is</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><em>Considering our current context and capability, what activities can be completed each sprint?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><em>This subset is the initial Definition of Done.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>Definition of Done</em> is weak when it is a small subset and strong when it almost equals <em>Potentially Shippable</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In huger organizations, the development teams discuss their context and select the subset of the activities that all teams think they realistically can do during the sprint.
This is their initial Definition of Done.
The teams that can do more will expand this product <em>Definition of Done</em> within their members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The difference between the Definition of Done and Potentially Shippable is referred to as Undone Work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><em>Potentially Shippable - Definition of Done = Undone Work</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Sprint is planned according to the <em>Definition of Done</em> and thus the <em>Undone Work</em> is excluded.
It is planned to be left undone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The terms <em>Potentially Shippable</em> and <em>Definition of Done</em> are often not used consistently.
To clarify the terms:</p>
</div>
<div class="hdlist">
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td class="hdlist1">
Potentially Shippable
</td>
<td class="hdlist2">
<p>All activities that must be performed before the product can be shipped.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="hdlist1">
Definition of Done
</td>
<td class="hdlist2">
<p>An agreement between the teams and their Product Owner on which activities are performed inside the Sprint.
A <em>Definition of Done</em> is perfect when it equals Potentially Shippable.
Teams strive to improve towards an ideal Definition of Done.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="hdlist1">
Undone Work
</td>
<td class="hdlist2">
<p>The difference between the Definition of Done and Potentially Shippable.
When the <em>Definition of Done</em> is perfect, then there is no <em>Undone Work</em>.
If this is not the case, the organization has to decide.
First, how we deal with the <em>Undone Work</em>.
Second, how we improve so that there is less <em>Undone Work</em> in the future.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="hdlist1">
Unfinished, or not done—work
</td>
<td class="hdlist2">

This is often confused with Undone Work.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="hdlist1">
Unfinished
</td>
<td class="hdlist2">
<p>is work that the team planned for but did not finish whereas Undone Work was never even planned for.
When a team has work that was not finished, then they ought to feel anxious and discuss improvement actions during their retrospective.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teams should never leave work-in-progress at the end of the sprint and <em>carry over</em> to the next one.
This causes a lack of transparency and reduces scope flexibility.
If they forecast too much work, they need to remove completed items, which they have not started yet.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>And the Status of <em>done</em> was confirmed by the product owner.</p>
</li>

<p>The following criteria are often overlooked and also need to be checked:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Was the technical documentation updated?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was the user documentation updated?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was the user documentation localized?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The localization for the application is done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The localization testing is done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The marketing input is done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The legal documents are done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The deployment and migration scripts are available.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The extension of the definition of done to deliver a potentially shippable product has often significant and profound impact on the structure of the organization and its processes.
Experienced agile coaches use the definition of done as an instrument for organizational changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the undone work is slowly removed from the delivery process, it triggers structural and process changes.
For example, the separate quality department responsible for the final tests is dissolved and their expertise is integrated in the development teams.</p>

Health check of your product and your development approach are certainly a good solution.</p>

<p>This post is the first of a series of articles identifying health checks with different focus.
We will identify strengths, potential weaknesses and hopefully find room for improvement.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The patient solely decides if a health check shall be performed.
The effort and depth of a health check are defined together with the patient.
The findings are considered confidential.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A short check with a feedback workshop presenting the insights requires around two work days.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A deeper and more intensive check requests more effort, between one and four weeks.
Upon completion, you can also hire a coach to implement selected findings and improve durably the health of your application.
The findings are often clear and the measures are straightforward.
The real work is to implement consistently the measures.</p>

<p>How clean, legible and maintainable is your source code?
Often it is best to start your health evaluation with your product source code.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One nice aspect of source code checks is that a whole set of tools is available on the market.
You still need an expert to provide the diagnostic but the gathering of data can be automated and quite inexpensive to gather.</p>

<p>First teams have successfully used Scrum to develop applications.
The news spread out and everybody wants to apply Scrum.
It is time to introduce Enterprise wide Agile with Scrum or Kanban or XP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your Company wants to introduce Enterprise Agility in their product development, quality assurance and sales departments.
The company as a whole shall transition to an agile organization and all teams shall adopt <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html">Shu Ha Ri</a> approach for such a change process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on our exhaustive experience, we recommend starting with a set of workshops with the goal of defining a tailored approach to adapt the structure and processes of the company and introduce enterprise agile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These workshops provide the platform to identify the company’s needs and strategic goals, and gather support from all participants.
Try the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">open space</a> format to involve all collaborators and identify their needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below we provide an approach which must be later tailored to the specific needs of the Company during the above-mentioned workshops.
The organizational needs for feature oriented planning and development of an application portfolio should be considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_approach">Approach</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We work with the Shu Ha Ri agile approach when introducing enterprise agile in the Company.
All collaborators will progress from the novice level through the proficient level before reaching the expert level.
You can also use the agile fluency model if you prefer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This model also maps very well to the “Awareness – Desire – Knowledge – Ability – Reinforcement “or ADFAR model.
The Company has already reached awareness and desire level because they want to introduce enterprise agile.
We describe below the activities for the development organization consisting of software development, product management and quality insurance departments, and the activities at company level.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_development_organization">Development Organization</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_shu_novice_level_learn_the_rules">Shu - Novice Level - „Learn the Rules“</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The duration of the novice level is at least six months.
The major activities are to align the collaborators and provide the needed knowledge through training and hands-on exercises.
Extensive training is aligned with experiences and industrial best practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All collaborators shall attend an introduction to agile and Scrum approaches.
All technical collaborators shall attend the Scrum - Master or Developer - training.
Each group of technical collaborators will learn specific techniques and skills necessary to work effectively in an agile product environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The agile coaches have two roles.
First, they facilitate and support the teams to implement all meetings, artifacts, and rules of the Scrum approach.
Second, they train the team members how to use learnt techniques such as clean code, pair programming, pair check-in, agile architecture, requirements elicitation, test driven development, agile quality assurance, acceptance test driven development, continuous integration, deployment and delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the initial training, the coaches ensure that this knowledge and ground rules are applied in daily activities.</p>

<p>Discuss the fact that the standard competencies of agile leadership and coaching – mentoring, facilitating, problem-solving, and conflict navigating – are essential to agile adoption, but simply not enough to sustain and grow agility within an organization.
We find that the unique blend of combining senior internal leaders with experienced agile coaches provides an unprecedented learning environment for all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand that most organizations adopt agile <em>Outside-In</em> - that means they start with a process change and expose organizational impediments.
The problem is that most of the organizational impediments are driven from cultural values deep within the organization.
The process changes rarely stick.</p>

<li>
<p>Identify an &#34;Inside-Out&#34; approach - that means we will start with the company culture.
Just as understanding the personality of a person is a key to working effectively with that person, understanding the culture of an organization is critical to its success in adopting, and more importantly sustaining, agility.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Architecture Decision Record ADR is a compact and traceable documentation of all important decisions taken during the realization of a product.
Use <a href="https://asciidoc.org/">asciidoc</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown/">Markdown</a> and Git to have an agile and lean documentation of your major decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The huge advantage of Architecture Design Record <em>ADR</em> is the timeline of the decisions.
It tremendously helps to understand the technical changes during the product lifecycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please try architecture design records to document your key decisions when developing your software product.
Feel free to identify better approaches</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_definition">Definition</h3>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.
A decision can be documented in an architecture design record (ADR).</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In each ADR file, write these sections:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Title</dt>
<dd>
<p>short present tense imperative phrase, less than 50 characters, like a git commit message.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Status</dt>
<dd>
<p>proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Context</dt>
<dd>
<p>what is the issue that we’re seeing that is motivating this decision or change.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Decision</dt>
<dd>
<p>what is the change that we’re actually proposing or doing.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Consequences</dt>
<dd>
<p>what becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I use asciidoc format to write all our architecture design records.
You can add to the same git repository as the product, visualize differences and if desired generate a nice looking document.
And my IDE IntelliJ IDEA has a nice plugin for this format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before using ADR I documented the decision changes as footnote in a Microsoft Word document.
The ADR approach is way more legible and easier to trace with the help of git repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_title">Title</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These documents have names that are short noun phrases.
For example, &#34;ADR 1: Deployment on Ruby on Rails 3.0.10&#34; or &#34;ADR 9: LDAP for Multiple tenant Integration&#34;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_context">Context</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and product local.
These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such.
The language in this section is value-neutral.
It is simply describing facts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_decision">Decision</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section describes our response to these forces.
It is stated in full sentences, with active voice.
&#34;We will …​&#34;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_status">Status</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A decision may be &#34;proposed&#34; if the product stakeholders haven’t agreed with it yet, or &#34;accepted&#34; once it is agreed.
If a later ADR changes or reverses a decision, it may be marked as &#34;deprecated&#34; or &#34;superseded&#34; with a reference to its replacement(s).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The status and the graph of related decisions can be tracked and visualize using tools.
You can also track your decisions without any tools, a regular product has often less than hundred decisions.
And you can always write a small parse utility to extract your dependency graph.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_consequences">Consequences</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision.
All consequences should be listed here, not just the &#34;positive&#34; ones.
A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and product in the future.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_tips_and_tricks">Tips and Tricks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The whole document describing an ADR should be one or two pages long.
We will write each ADR as if it is a conversation with a future developer.
This requires good writing style, with full sentences organized into paragraphs.
Bullets are acceptable only for visual style, not as an excuse for writing sentence fragments (Bullets kill people, even PowerPoint bullets).</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cost of undocumented decisions is hard to measure, but the effects usually include duplicated efforts.
Other engineers try to solve the same problems or competing solutions (two third-party libraries that do the same thing).</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The approach is very similar to how you would document a software pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Believe and respect is the prime directive.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.</p>

<p>Lately I was asked how many bugs and smells detected through SonarQube were acceptable for a software product.

<p>Truly, if the intrinsic quality of the source code is low, it is undeniably a failure.

<p>I am <em>ashamed</em> to see software developers not implementing the above measures on a daily basis.
I <em>despair</em> encountering Scrum masters who tolerate the situation.

<p>What are the main hurdles to introduce agile approaches in Swiss companies?
The Swiss agile trends report was published for the last ten years and learn us the difficulties and successes of agile transformations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SwissQ has published a &#34;SwissQ Software Development Switzerland 2018&#34;, the tenth version of this report.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Introducing agile company-wide was and is a cultural change process.
Such a change takes time and sometimes hurts.
Too often, organizations stop the process and revert to all command and control approaches with Waterfall product management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without commitment of senior management, the initiative will fail.
In other words <em>Walk the talk</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You must teach, coach, and support your collaborators through the transition.
You need to believe in them and provide an environment where they can safely learn and experiment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end, collaborator purpose, customer satisfaction, and business value matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The study can be downloaded as PDF from their website.
See previous blogs for the results of years 2016, 2013 and 2012.
Below some findings of the study.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_slower_adoption_of_agile_approaches">Slower Adoption of Agile Approaches</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The adoption of agile frameworks has markedly slowed down in Switzerland.
And hybrid methods based on Waterfall methodology are often used.
It is fascinating to see companies trying to merge a linear approach with highly iterative and incremental approaches.
It shall be clear that success will only be elusive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The data of the study reflect this fact through the abysmal collaborator satisfaction with these hybrid approaches (see chapter 13).
Less than 25% of employees are satisfied with the development process of their company.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_major_hurdles_when_introducing_agile_approaches">Major Hurdles When Introducing Agile Approaches</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The list of hurdles for a successful introduction of agile approaches was updated.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">69%</dt>
<dd>
<p>Culture change and you need senior management support</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">54%</dt>
<dd>
<p>Non adapted overall processes because local optimizations have a limited effect</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">42%</dt>
<dd>
<p>Missing product overview because a company sells products</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">42%</dt>

<p>Focus on business value because a company shall earn money</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">25%</dt>
<dd>
<p>Missing agile know-how of collaborators and you shall train your collaborators</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We reached a major threshold.
The majority of interviewed companies have more than 500 IT collaborators.
These big companies are struggling to introduce agile approaches company-wide.
Interestingly, 75% of all companies plan to increase investment in the agile introduction and transition projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One interesting consequence is the company compiling the report is actively poaching potential agile candidates from these big laggard companies!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The majority of teams use Scrum or Kanban.
The associated events and tools are used.
Deeper values are often missing.,
Observable examples are test driven development, acceptance test driven development, clean code or refactoring.
The key is:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><em>To be agile, not to do agile</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We wrote in previous blogs that introducing Scrum in the development department or in the whole company is a change process.
The coaches should be trained in change management and have experiences with resistance to changes.
Our experience shows senior management is often not ready to move along the cultural change path.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_sonar">What is Sonar?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> is a central server that processes full analyses (triggered by the various SonarQube Scanners).
Its purpose is to give a 360° vision about the quality of your code base.
For this, it analyzes all the source lines of your product on a regular basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It should be added that SonarQube also performs scans with well-known third party analyzers (<a href="https://spotbugs.github.io/">SpotBugs</a> - previously FindBugs -,
<a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a>, <a href="https://pmd.github.io/">PMD</a>) whereas SonarLint does not include those.
I think the reason is a prioritization on performance and findBugs relying on java byte-code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_sonarlint">What is SonarLint?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SonarLint lives only in your IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse or Visual Studio).
Its purpose is to give instantaneous feedback as you type your code.
For this, it concentrates on what code you are adding or updating.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Findings are displayed in the source code with information such as rule violation, rating of the rule and explanation.
You have a window where all findings are displayed to provide an overview and navigation support.
You are free to analyze a single file, a package, or the whole product; you can also exclude files or packages from the analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Connect SonarLint to your preferred code quality application.
It then uses the same code analyzers, rules and settings locally that are used on the server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Issues marked as Won’t Fix or False Positive in SonarQube or SonarCloud disappear from your IDE.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both SonarLint and SonarQube rely on the same static source code analyzers – most of them being written using SonarSource technology.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_to_use_it">How to use It?</h3>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>the SonarLint in your favorite IDE</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>configure the SonarCube instance to synchronize the rule set used in your product.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the plugin to access your SonarCube instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run it.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>See the messages in the next few seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jump to the source and correct the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterate until all issues are solved.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run your unit tests and acceptance tests – TDD and ATDD -.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commit your changes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach guarantees you always release source code with less SonarCube issues, therefore SonarCube always show no findings for new code and for refactored
code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>The last months I was often confronted with software products having insufficient quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Insufficient means late delivery, and few new features.
The effort to correct errors in the field eats <strong>30% to 50%</strong> away from the development budget.
How can such a dreadful situation occur?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One root cause is the low quality of the source code and ignorance of basic coding design approaches.
We are not talking about complex design activities or complex patterns; we are discussing basic approaches how to write correct and maintainable code.</p>

<p>You shall be a proud software craftsman [<a href="#software-craftsman">1</a>].
You shall work as a professional and deliver professional results.
I recommend any Java developer:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have formal training in the Java language and library [<a href="#java-puzzlers">2</a>].
For example you should consider a Java Programmer certification for the current JDK you are working daily with.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why do we define metrics and KPI?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, we want to find out how good the build-in quality of our software artifacts is.
Second, we want to improve the build-in quality through experiments and use the metrics to judge the success of these experiments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the Key Performance Indicators - KPI - provide plausibility checks by qualifying the intrinsic quality of software artifacts against quantifiable strategic objectives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Measurements shall be cheap to gather and as much as possible generated automatically through the tooling landscape.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We provide two sets of measurements to find out how supportive the development process is for quality and how to evaluate the quality of the artifacts.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_definitions">Definitions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A metric is a measure or a combination of measures for quantitatively assessing or improving a product, a process or a team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>key performance indicator</em> is a metric that</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>is tied to a strategic objective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have at least one defined time-bound target value - a number, a trend, a variation, etc. -</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, you must define your strategic objectives before you can use KPIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lean approaches have an imperative to reduce cycle-time, eliminate waste and tend to zero-defect products.
The last one is a corollary because defects are waste. Please use this imperative to define your agile and lean KPIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your tooling landscape does not support automatic gathering of a specific metric, you shall make it optional until you have solved your tooling weaknesses.
Accurate and real-time automated measurements are of tremendous importance for acceptance and lasting success.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_process_aspects">Process Aspects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The optimal lean software development process has a batch size of one, almost no waiting time, no superfluous stock and no quality issues.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This metrics shall be automatically provided through the issue and product backlog system.
For example, the “best of breed” JIRA tool has build-in reports for all the above metrics, so the tools you use should also have them.</p>

<h3 id="_what_has_changed">What has changed?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oracle has decided to release a new JDK two times a year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next release of Java 10 aka 18.3 will be available on March 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JDK 11 aka 18.9 will be released in September 2018.
Java 11 will also be a long-term support <em>LTS</em> release.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_visible_change">The Visible Change</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The visible change is the dawn of the keyword <strong>var</strong>.
Now instead of typing the type declaration of a local variable - local to a method, a block or an instruction - you can just use the keyword var.
The constraint being that the variable is initialized at declaration.
Stay tune for more support in JDK 11.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the type declaration is a complex generic type definition, the var shortcut is a boon.
The code is less verbose and the legibility is at least as good.
When the type is a class name, I got the impression. the benefit is less clear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an exercise, I updated the source code of open source libraries which I have written and the associated tests as in</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first impression is that the new construct sometimes simplifies the code of the library and very often improve the test cases.
Perhaps it takes time until I am accustomed to the new way of writing Java code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_under_the_hood_changes">Under the Hood Changes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The source code of the JDK is consolidated into one repository.
It makes development work more efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The garbage collector shall have a clear and documented API.
Developing and adding new garbage collectors is easier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Various updates such as the Unicode newest version.
The extensions are used in library classes to better support locales.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open JDK and Oracle JDK are slowly merging.
For example, CA certificates will be provided to OpenJDK by Oracle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_outlook">Outlook</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The rhythm of releases is staggering higher.
Starting Spring 2018, we will have * The new rule as blogged by Mark Reinhold <a href="https://mreinhold.org/blog/forward-faster">Moving Java Forward Faster</a>.
* You will get a new JDK every six months * You will get security updates every three months * You will get a long-term support release every three years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means that you shall update your JDK in development environment six times a year if you want to install the new JDK and the security releases.
We recommend automating the process in your environment.
And you shall deliver your applications in Docker containers to support the whole ecosystem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tool landscape is still struggling to adapt to the new rhythm.
I am working with IntelliJ IDE and I had to wait for the EAP 2018.3 before being able to write JDK 10 code in the IDE.
I use Gradle as a building tool and also to wait until JDK 10 was at least partially supported.
And I am still waiting for the update of code coverage plugin.
Before that, I was back to stone age, writing software with a text editor and compiling it with the command line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The library landscape is often behind. They are regularly incompatible with the newest version of the JDK.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JavaFX will be removed from the regular JDK distribution in Fall 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cloud landscape does not support the latest JDK as SAAS.
You must provide your custom docker images with the expected JDK or JRE.
So we are back to IAAS.</p>

<p>How can you create better products and services?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How can you delight your customers, your collaborators, and your stakeholders?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We identified six levers to multiply the effectivity of your agile development teams and empower them to create great services and products.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please add these tools to your toolbox and create great products.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_design_thinking_and_customer_experience">Design Thinking and Customer Experience</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You solve customer problems through intuitive services and products.
Customers&#39; expectations should fit with their experience with your products.
That is why they should be involved in the whole definition and realization process.
At the beginning, to understand the need and to test first ideas.
During the implementation, they are directly asked for feedback, which then flows into further development steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Go out with your <em>incomplete</em> product as soon as possible.
Each iteration should deliver an upgraded version of the product.
The pressure to deliver is huge. A design thinking iteration has a duration of at most one week.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lean_startup_and_lean_ux">Lean Startup and Lean UX</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Minimum viable products - MVP - are first developed as minimally functional products.
Within 60 days, a physical prototype will be created that customers can test during this time.
The software component shall be delivered after the first or second iteration, which means in less than one month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>New technologies such as 3D printing, cheap hardware and IoT boards, continuous delivery, simulation enable your teams to deliver on time.
These are not pure mockups but executable applications.
If it appeals to the customer, the MVP will evolve gradually to a minimum marketable product – MMP –.
The focus is always on adding customer value.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_beyond_budgeting_approaches">Beyond Budgeting Approaches</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no long-term budget plan for products and projects.
After each cycle of customer feedback, the goals and budget are evaluated again.
The value streams have agile teams that work like small companies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each team has a Product Owner - PO - who has overall responsibility for their respective product.
Realizations are further funded, modified or canceled on the basis of initial results, meaning after customer and technical tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The product financing is following a start-up approach and not based on the yearly budget as usual in larger companies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_co_location_and_team_ownership">Co-location and Team ownership</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Work is done across departments, in cross-functional teams.
All those who can contribute to the success of the product (e.g. company organization, IT, market management, or sales) sit in one room.
They form the agile team.
Co-location ensures lean coordination processes as well as speed and quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Co-location also means: You are moving.
The teams move into a room and work focused together on their product.
There are no phones, no other projects, and no outside distractions.
They use collaboration tools - chats, wikis, Scrum boards -.
Scrum teams are wholly focused on their product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People check three times a day their emails; otherwise the email client is closed and inactive.
All phones have voicemail.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_agile_methods_and_craftsmanship">Agile Methods and Craftsmanship</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Employee training is essential.
In the value streams, we provide staff with experienced coaches to build knowledge in agile methods and software craftsmanship.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Work is done according to proven agile methods.
Software development relies on modern and agile techniques such as pair programming, refactoring, test driven development, continuous integration, and Scrum.
For bigger product development we use <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Read this <a href="../../2018/one-way-to-improve-your-scrum-approach/">One Way to Improve Your Scrum Approach</a>
for a description of modern agile development procedures.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_elastic_infrastructure">Elastic Infrastructure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We shall use the state of industry technology.
This enables test-driven development - ATDD, TDD -, meaning predefined automated software tests that run in real-time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cloud infrastructure provides unlimited processing capabilities for development, test, and deployment of software artifacts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Developers have fast notebooks, fast SSD, plenty of RAM, and 4K external screens.
In addition, the technical infrastructure enables software to be scaled and adjustments made immediately - CI, CD, DevOps -.
The goal is to deliver a software release in production every few hours if needed.</p>

<p>Scrum was initially developed for managing and developing products.
Starting in the early 1990s, Scrum has been used extensively, worldwide, to:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Research and identify viable markets, technologies, and product capabilities.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Sustain and renew products.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The essence of Scrum is a small team of people.
The individual team is highly flexible and adaptive.
These strengths continue operating in single, several, and networks of teams.
They develop, release, operate and sustain the work and work products for thousands of people.</p>

<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Updated the first paragraph of the Daily Scrum section to read</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team.
The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint.
At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours.
This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and f<em>orecasting upcoming Sprint work</em>.
The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Updated the Daily Scrum section to provide clarity on the goals of the Daily Scrum including this text</dt>
<dd>
<p>The structure of the meeting is set by the Development Team and can be conducted in different ways if it focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal.
Some Development Teams will use questions, some will be more discussion based. Here is an example of what might be used:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Added clarity around time-boxes</dt>
<dd>
<p>Using the words “at most” to remove any questions that the time-box for Events means maximum length, but could be shorter.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The guide clarifies the daily Scrum event. It establishes a daily feedback loop for improvement.</strong></p>

<p>To ensure continuous improvement, it includes at least one high priority way in which the team works, identified in the previous Retrospective meeting.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Added clarity to the Increment section</dt>
<dd>
<p>An increment is a body of inspectable, &#34;Done&#34; work that supports empiricism at the end of the Sprint.
The increment is a step toward a vision or goal.</p>
</dd>

<h3 id="_previous_changes">Previous Changes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The biggest change for the daily work was introduced in the previous revision – read previous blog -.
The word <em>commitment</em> is no more used in the description of the planning event.
The team now provides a <strong>forecast</strong> which stories shall be realized until the end of the sprint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This change was necessary because people - especially command and control responsible - did not read the official definition of commitment - Oxford Dictionary -.</p>

<div class="paragraph text-center">
<p><em>The state or quality of being dedicated to a cause, an activity.</em></p>

<p>The second big innovation was the introduction of five Scrum values: Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage.</p>

<p>You are serious about delivering the functions your customer needs.
Each story you implement has acceptance criteria.
These acceptance criteria define your requirements – see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example">specification by example</a> –.
Your acceptance tests document and validate these requirements.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have a choice, use cloud continuous integration for team activities.
Decide if you prefer the cloud approach – e.g. with TravisCI or Bitbucket Pipelines – or Jenkins within Docker for your local integration activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A smooth running CI pipeline is a boost for team morale and motivation.
To know your application compiles and runs through all your automated tests anytime is such a good feeling.</p>

<h4 id="_continuous_delivery_and_deployment">Continuous Delivery and Deployment</h4>

<p>Nothing beats a big analog board in the team room as the ideal information radiator.
If you want your collocated to work effectively and solve problems as a team, you shall provide an analog board.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">Trello, Stride, BitBucket, Hipchat and others Atlassian tools for distributed teams</dt>
<dd>
<p>The first advice is to have a collocated team.
The productivity and performance gains are unachievable in a distributed environment.
We have very good experience with Atlassian and Google App solutions to mitigate the drawback of distributed teams and establish a team work atmosphere.
But a collocated team still rocks.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">IntelliJ IDEA</dt>

<p>This IDE is the choice for refactoring, powerful context suggestions and efficient programming.
If you use Eclipse or Netbeans just try a friendly refactoring competition with an IDEA convert.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">Git</dt>
<dd>
<p>Please stop using Subversion, CVS, TFS or other geriatric tools.
Agile development, efficient integration in delivery pipelines, and extensive refactoring require Git.
Just migrate now to Git and leave dreaded message <em>Tree conflict detected, please solve manually</em> behind you.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These tools shall be used in the agile way.
You do not have long-lived branches in your source code management tool.
Either you have only short-lived local branches or better, you just work against trunk.
Complex branching strategies are just waste for a lean practitioner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I decided to collect all these hints in the same long post.
They belong together.
Every day you design a solution, you code it, test it, improve it and guarantee its quality.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These activities are tangled together to producing a product you are proud of.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And yes, I know about GitHub, Gitlab, Slack, Ant, Maven, Jetty, Amazon Cloud, AssertJ, Subversion, Eclipse, Netbeans and other good tools.
But I still prefer the ones above; I am convinced to be more productive with them.</p>
