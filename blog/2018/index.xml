      <guid>https://blog.tangly.net/blog/2018/how-to-reach-the-software-quality-graal/</guid>
      <description>Lately I was asked how many bugs and smells detected through SonarQube were acceptable for a software product. And a Scrum master inquired which organizational changes are necessary to empower software developers to write good code. Speechless and dumbfounded, I was unable to answer these questions.&#xA;After some time, I realized these people believe tools can measure the quality of software. But tools can only measure non-quality.&#xA;They tell you when you are doing it wrong, only your heart can tell you when you are doing it right.</description>

      <description>What are the main hurdles to introducing agile approaches in Swiss companies? The Swiss agile trends report was published for the last ten years and learn us the difficulties and successes of agile transformations.&#xA;SwissQ has published a &amp;#34;SwissQ Software Development Switzerland 2018&amp;#34;, the tenth version of this report.&#xA;Introducing agile company-wide was and is a cultural change process. Such a change takes time and sometimes hurts. Too often, organizations stop the process and revert to all command and control approaches with Waterfall product management.</description>

      <description>Remove issues before they reach customer sites. No quality problems shall reach your Git master branch.&#xA;SonarQube is a central server that processes full analyses (triggered by the various SonarQube Scanners).&#xA;Its purpose is to give a 360Â° vision about the quality of your code base. For this, it analyzes all the source lines of your product on a regular basis.&#xA;It should be added that SonarQube also performs scans with well-known third party analyzers (SpotBugs - previously FindBugs -, Checkstyle, PMD) whereas SonarLint does not include those.</description>

      <description>An agile organization is able to deliver or change her direction at any time without additional cost.&#xA;More companies want to become truly agile and book an expensive journey to the holy land of agility. Often travelers never reach their true destination.&#xA;The LeSS people have a clear set of conditions to increase the odds.&#xA;All my experiences confirm these conditions are essential for success.&#xA;LeSS Criteria Use these criteria as a checklist to evaluate your current agile transformation.</description>

      <description>The last months I was often confronted with software products having insufficient quality.&#xA;Insufficient means late delivery, and few new features. The effort to correct errors in the field eats 30% to 50% away from the development budget. How can such a dreadful situation occur?&#xA;One root cause is the low quality of the source code and ignorance of basic coding design approaches.&#xA;We are not talking about complex design activities or complex patterns; we are discussing basic approaches how to write correct and maintainable code.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.tangly.net/blog/2018/why-do-you-need-metrics-and-kpi-in-agile-product-development/</guid>
      <description>Why do we define metrics and KPI?&#xA;First, we want to find out how good the build-in quality of our software artifacts is.&#xA;Second, we want to improve the build-in quality through experiments and use the metrics to judge the success of these experiments.&#xA;And the Key Performance Indicators KPI provide plausibility checks by qualifying the intrinsic quality of software artifacts against quantifiable strategic objectives.&#xA;Measurements shall be cheap to gather and as much as possible generated automatically through the tooling landscape.</description>
