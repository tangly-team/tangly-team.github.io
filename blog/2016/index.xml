      <description>I often hear discussions asking who is performing the traditional product leader tasks in Scrum.&#xA;This is in general an excuse to state that Scrum alone cannot work and classical product leaders are still needed.&#xA;I encourage you to classify these so-called regular product manager activities. Often these jobs are plain reporting progress to various boards and micromanaging the development team.&#xA;I truly acknowledge the importance and value of a line manager caring for his collaborators and nurturing the success of the products they develop.</description>

      <title>Found a Limited Liability Company in Switzerland</title>

      <description>I left the company I founded 20 years ago and needed a new home to work and have access to social insurance.&#xA;The best legal construct in Switzerland and in Europe is to establish a limited liability company.&#xA;You need such a construct in Switzerland to work as a software specialist. The legal Swiss institutions, such as taxes, social insurances, and accident insurances are challenging and almost unfair with freelancers.</description>

      <description>Lately, people often ask me what is an agile company.&#xA;They have an understanding of agile software development techniques such as Scrum, Lean Software Development, Kanban, eXtreme Programming but no clue how a company could be agile.&#xA;What does it mean to be an agile organization?&#xA;One way to approach this theme is to implement concepts of the above-mentioned agile approaches.&#xA;These are the pillars for iterative incremental improvements.</description>

      <description>What are the main hurdles to introducing agile approaches in Swiss companies?&#xA;Introducing agile company-wide is a cultural change process. Such a change takes time and sometimes hurts.&#xA;Without the commitment of senior management, the initiative will fail.&#xA;Doubt that lean or agile works for big projects, doubt you can convince your collaborators and middle management, doubt your customers agree with lean,&#xA;In the end, what matters are collaborator purpose, customer satisfaction, business value.</description>

      <description>You are working in a small mostly collocated development team. Sometimes a team member works from a remote location.&#xA;You have one git repository accessible to all team members.&#xA;This repository is used to share source code and documentation artifacts.&#xA;You use the actual industrial standard for version control systems is git.&#xA;You decided to use branches to implement new features or fix errors instead of using Trunk-Based Development.</description>

      <title>The Version of the Scrum Guide 2011</title>

      <guid>https://blog.tangly.net/blog/2016/the-version-of-the-scrum-guide-2011/</guid>
      <description>The new version of the Scrum Guide written by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland has been available since July 2011.&#xA;You should regularly read the Scrum guide to reflect how your teams are applying agile principles and ideas.&#xA;You should also consult the seminal Agile Manifesto and the 12 Agile Manifesto Principles.&#xA;The older version was published in May 2009.&#xA;I found quite interesting the precision of the Scrum Masterâ€™s responsibility.</description>

      <title>Scrum Master is a full-time Role</title>

      <description>I am very happy we discuss in depth the role, responsibilities and activities of a good Scrum Master. I fully agree with Scrum advocates that Scrum Master is a dedicated full-time job.&#xA;I am also convinced a Scrum Master can support multiple experienced Scrum teams. The Large Scale Scrum framework LeSS states a full-time Scrum Master supports 1 to 3 teams.&#xA;I worked with quite a few Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and Scrum teams.</description>

      <title>Books for Persons interested in Agile Approaches</title>
      <link>https://blog.tangly.net/blog/2016/books-for-persons-interested-in-agile-approaches/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.tangly.net/blog/2016/books-for-persons-interested-in-agile-approaches/</guid>
      <description>I am often told that it is difficult to use Agile/Scrum approaches for brown field projects or for big projects or for distributed projects or for in other situations.&#xA;Interestingly, these people also state that the same problems exist with traditional approaches such as RUP/OpenUP, Waterfall Model, V Model defined as a formal standard in Germany V-Modell Entwicklungsstandard, and the Swiss variant called HERMES.&#xA;Agile approaches are currently the standard for new projects and are thought in technical universities.</description>

      <title>PMI-ACP Certification</title>
      <link>https://blog.tangly.net/blog/2016/pmi-acp-certification/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.tangly.net/blog/2016/pmi-acp-certification/</guid>
      <description>Unknown reference: lean-agile-software-develpment I learnt quite a few new acronyms and techniques when studying for the PMI-ACP certification program. In this post, I collected these acronyms, some definition and the bibliography you should know before attending the examination.&#xA;The main advantage of having it is that you no longer need to argue with PMI certified product managers if agile is applicable to software projects.&#xA;The main interest of PMI-ACP certification is their collection of concepts taken from Agile, eXtreme Programming, Scrum and Lean.</description>

      <title>Why I use a MacBookPro and OS X</title>

      <description>I loved Linux as a young developer. I compiled new kernels during evening sessions. I worked hard to install and configure drivers to support the hardware I had bought.&#xA;I explored forums and talked with technical support specialists to activate hardware or support the resolution of my display. I struggled days to have the correct drivers for the graphic card and communication components of my notebook.&#xA;I grew older and decided to enjoy my evenings and weekends with my family and friends.</description>

      <title>Do Agile Methods - Scrum - Motivate your Team?</title>

      <description>Decision makers and waterfall aficionados loudly ask if agile approaches are worth the hype.&#xA;Does the approach really promote team work?&#xA;Well, my current experience is that the answer is a sounding YES.&#xA;Developers love to develop software products using Scrum. The motivation and positive energy just explode.&#xA;People talk together, build as a team better products and enjoy the daily activities.&#xA;Stakeholders and customers or users embrace the advantages they get.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Undone Work when Working with Regulatory Departments</title>

      <description>The Scrum and agile mantra is to have a ready-to-ship product each time a sprint is completed. You must avoid any incomplete activities at any price.&#xA;Incomplete activities are also called Undone Work. They are technical debts in your software, hindering its delivery to users. They are expended money you cannot invoice to your customers.&#xA;Regulatory and traditional quality insurance departments request all kinds of documents, such as review, test results, risk analysis matrix.</description>
