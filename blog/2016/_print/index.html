<div class="paragraph">
<p>I often hear discussions asking who is performing the <em>traditional</em> product leader tasks in Scrum.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is in general an excuse to state that <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> alone cannot work and classical product leaders are still needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I encourage you to classify these so-called regular product manager activities.
Often these jobs are plain reporting progress to various boards and micromanaging the development team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I truly acknowledge the importance and value of a line manager caring for his collaborators and nurturing the success of the products they develop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But to be honest, these activities are implemented by good people and technical leaders and almost never by some product managers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below a list of tasks you do <strong>NOT</strong> need anymore to do in <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make commitments on behalf of the team about how much they can get done by a certain date or estimate effort for the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coerce the team that the commitments made on their behalf are attainable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coerce the team to change their estimates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give direction to the team on how to implement the work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor the team’s progress to make sure they stay on schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step in and determine the solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct weekly status update and face to face meetings with the team to surface issues and provide direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide motivation and push the team to work harder than they might want to use carrots and sticks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decide task assignments among the team members and follow up on tasks to verify completion.
Force them to work during weekends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be responsible for the team doing the right thing at the right time in the right way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update Gantt charts for the iteration and release planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding out those requirements means to explain to team members what they should implement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review the documents and code to guaranty quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain upper management why the product is late and why you need additional resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain upper management why you cannot transfer a team member to another product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attend weekly progress and escalation meetings to explain in detail the status of your product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define the priority of the next activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above Scrum anti-patterns picture shows more common misunderstandings about the Scrum framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a Scrum practitioner, you should regularly read material, attend formal trainings, and seek advanced certifications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You as Scrum master or agile product manager have to perform important and useful tasks:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Help to remove impediments to increase the velocity of a team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coach team to implement Scrum and reflect on their activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA/">Plan-Do-Check-Adapt</a> <em>Plan Do Check Act</em> principle is built into Scrum with retrospectives and sprint reviews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coach product owner to deliver a groomed and refined backlog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform and support all product’s stakeholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you reflect on these two lists it becomes obvious that the first list describes malfunctions and the second one describes mechanisms how to improve continuously - lean principles -.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Sutherland">Jeff Sutherland</a> gives some interesting insights about the Scrum master</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Scrum master enforces Scrum practices <em>Coaching rather than command and control</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Scrum master effort is</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Few problems: for a small team 10%, for a large team, 50% of your working time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many problems: for a small team 50%, for a large team, 100% of your working time until the team reaches flow status</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Scrum master is a change agent and supports the organization to become more agile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I experimented with the Scrum master being part of the team, or Scrum master working for multiple teams.
Experience has shown us that the full-time Scrum master is more effective.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I left the company I founded 20 years ago and needed a new home to work and have access to social insurance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best legal construct in Switzerland and in Europe is to establish a limited liability company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need such a construct in Switzerland to work as a software specialist.
The legal Swiss institutions, such as taxes, social insurances, and accident insurances are challenging and almost unfair with freelancers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had to found a limited liability company with a capital of CHF 20&#39;000.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here the steps for the impatient.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_foundation">Foundation</h3>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.swissregistration.ch/">Swissregistration</a> wrote the statutes for the company and performed the foundation with certifying notary for CHF 780.
Six hours after the first phone call they sent me the electronic documents.
The next day, the documents were delivered in paper form.
It was really impressive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before you can find a company you must deposit the capital into a special account.
I choose <a href="https://www.postfinance.ch/">Postfinance</a>.
It is a well-known Swiss institute and their fee is only CHF 145.
They insisted I met one of their collaborators to fill their forms – probably never heard about web forms -.
I had bad luck.
They needed three weeks to create the account and send payment confirmation.
They were aware of the problem and very helpful, but it still took three weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon reception of the payment confirmation, I sent all signed documents to <a href="https://www.swissregistration.ch/">Swissregistration</a>.
The next day the company was founded, and I received the official paper documents a few hours later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I went to <a href="https://www.zg.ch/behoerden/volkswirtschaftsdirektion/handelsregisteramt">Handelsregisteramt Zug</a> to register the company.
They were very nice but told me they had a lot of work.
Two weeks later, they finally registered the company and sent me the papers and an invoice of CHF 780.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few phone calls later <a href="http://www.postfinance.ch/">Postfinance</a> converted the account into a regular account.
They give me access to the founding capital minus their fee</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the waiting time, I started to organise for the mandatory insurances you need in Switzerland</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>BVG – the best offer was from <a href="https://www.axa-winterthur.ch/">Axa Winthertur</a>.
They also help me because the company CRIF AG wrongly classified the activities of the new company.
They never contacted me and their NOGA classification has a huge impact on my costs.
They are arrogant morons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BU/NBU – the best offer was from <a href="https://www.baloise.ch/">Basler Versicherung</a>
When starting a software startup I suggest not concluding any other insurances</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The government controlled social insurance contracts can only be initiated once the company is registered in the Swiss company registry.
The AHV center needed more than two weeks to confirm my registration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lessons_learnt">Lessons Learnt</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The costs of founding my limited company in Switzerland are CHF 1&#39;705 or 8.5% of the capital of the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state-owned companies and state services are very slow; in my case 20 times slower than the private ones.
On the bright side, their collaborators are very supportive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public or big private companies, such as insurance firms, are incapable of sending documents or invoices electronically.
They only use paper mail.
Upon inquiry, their collaborators told me their processes are incapable of handling modern communication ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon foundation, you get pseudo-official letters from various companies to sell dubious services.
Just throw them away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The industry development office of Kanton Zug has no clues about start-up companies; the ones in Zürich and Luzern seem better.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Lately, people often ask me what is an agile company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They have an understanding of agile software development techniques such as <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development/">Lean Software Development</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban/">Kanban</a>, <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> but no clue how a company could be agile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way to approach this theme is to implement concepts of the above-mentioned agile approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are the pillars for iterative incremental improvements.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scrum_pillars">Scrum Pillars</h3>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Transparency</dt>
<dd>
<p>You trust all collaborators to provide their best when working on the product.
They need full access to all relevant information: quality, progress, budget, people and financial data.
They use the data to select the best alternatives to reach the company’s goals.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Inspection</dt>
<dd>
<p>You cherish a failure culture because inspections will find weak points.
You need a culture where people are never blamed.
One consequence is that you eliminate management by objectives, and bonuses in your company.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Adaptation</dt>
<dd>
<p>You are ready to learn better approaches and truly believe there is a better solution.
Processes change regularly bottom-up, company’s budget can only be a rolling indicative budget, and planning has to be <em>continuously</em> updated.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also pursue desirable attitudes or values of agile persons.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scrum_values">Scrum Values</h3>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Commitment</dt>
<dd>
<p>As an employee you want to win, you are engaged.
Every manager truly believes you work best to achieve the goals.
If not, this manager made a mistake by hiring or keeping you.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Courage</dt>
<dd>
<p>You are ready to say “I am wrong” because being wrong opens the door for improvement.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Focus</dt>
<dd>
<p>You daily optimise the customers’ value and thrive for excellence.
As a developer, you do not work on projects, you work on excellent products.
You provide value to your customers.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Openness</dt>
<dd>
<p>You seek better ideas and ways of doing.
Openness requires transparency and respect.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Respect</dt>
<dd>
<p>You truly respect customers, team members, collaborators, and people.
In your team, I will not hear any disrespectful comments about people.</p>

</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Make people awesome</dt>
<dd>
<p>Dedicated collaborators want to give their best.
Give them a purpose, a goal, empower them and let them climb the mountain.
Thriving people need purpose, excellence and autonomy.
They are happier, healthier and more productive.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Deliver value continuously</dt>
<dd>
<p>Maintain sustainable pace and stability, all divisions of the organisation should focus on customer value.
At the end of the day, successful products are the only reason you get your paycheck.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Make safety a prerequisite</dt>
<dd>
<p>People do their best in their daily work, you believe in McGregor Y theory.
Trust them and support them to become excellent.
You shall develop self-awareness to increase safety.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Experiment and learn rapidly</dt>
<dd>
<p>You make mistakes, you learn and increase continuously the delivered value.
You have a learning culture, you inspect and adapt.
You can react to new opportunities faster than competitors.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above concepts are comprehensible.
How do you know if you are moving in the right direction?
A few concrete tests help you find out if you are an agile department or company.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Be agile</em> instead of <em>do agile</em>.
Practice the above attitudes and do not just follow a checklist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nobody micromanages in your company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Feel accountable</em> instead of <em>being accountable</em>.
You want to improve, and your company as a natural part of the daily work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Compliment every collaborator</em> you are working with at least once a week instead of <em>evaluating weaknesses and criticising people</em>.
Do you lead by example?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No management by objectives - MBO - or bonuses are established in your company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every collaborator has access to all company data, every collaborator can request process and tool changes.
We favour <em>Individuals and interactions over tools and processes</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to be excellent in your work.
You have a purpose and autonomy in your daily work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team members take the decision to hire or to fire collaborators, not the department responsible or the human resources group.
Think about collaborators selecting their leaders, about managers being servants, about information available to all collaborators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you say these essential sentences at least three times a week?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the most important one word, <em>Sorry.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the most important two words, <em>Thank you.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the most important three words, <em>I was wrong.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the most important four words, <em>Can I help you?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I truly believe that we all want a fulfilling job which improves our world.
I cannot understand other reasons to spend 40 hours and more per week for something less valuable.
Take the above principles and apply them to your daily work.
There are universal values to establish a working atmosphere you are proud of.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>I agree with all of you to desire a fulfilling job is only true if you earn enough money to pay your monthly bills.</em></p>

<p>The described approach is optimal for small teams.
The approach is compatible to pull requests if you introduce such a workflow later.
You do not need to pull requests when you are working collocated.
I prefer pair programming and pair check-in sessions against the trunk.</p>

Ken and Jeff have a clear idea who is in charge of this.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:</p>

<li>
<p><em>Leading</em> and <em>coaching</em> the organization in its Scrum adoption;</p>

<li>
<p><em>Planning</em> Scrum implementations within the organization;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><em>Working</em> with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum Master is a main driver for the introduction of Scrum in all departments and levels in the company.
He needs senior management support, but the Scrum Master daily job is to spread Scrum in the company.</p>

<h3 id="_who_should_coach_the_product_owner_to_write_a_better_backlog_and_clarify_the_vision">Who should coach the product owner to write a better backlog and clarify the vision?</h3>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Finding</em> techniques for effective Product Backlog management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Clearly, communicating vision</em>, goals, and Product Backlog items to the Development Team;.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum Master should also coach the product owner and support him in the long term planning, the communication of the vision and backlog management.
The vision and goals of the product should always contain an overall planning frame. During the product empirical evidence will trigger revision of the
milestones and product planning.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_the_meaning_of_done_and_a_piece_of_potentially_shippable_product">What is the meaning of done and a piece of potentially shippable product?</h3>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as “Done”, everyone must understand what “Done” means.
Although this varies significantly per Scrum Team, members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure transparency.
This is the <em>Definition of Done</em> for the Scrum Team and is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Development Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint.
This Increment is working product, so a Product Owner may choose to immediately release it.
Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly tested, ensuring that all Increments work together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their <em>Definition of Done</em> will expand to include more stringent criteria for higher quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints.
At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be ““Done””, which means it must be in usable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s Definition of “Done”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>It must be in useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to actually release it.</em></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So at the end of sprint all stories realized since the start of the product must be correct.
Therefore you need automated acceptance tests to guaranty their correctness.
The Scrum team must guaranty that at the end of each sprint all functions of the product work as specified and accepted by the product owner in the current and previous sprint reviews.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Higher quality is reached through extreme programming approach: test driven development, clean code, pair programming, pair check-in, coding dojo, static analysis tools.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_does_scrum_consider_long_term_planning">Does Scrum consider long-term planning?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes it is a major activity performed by the Scrum Master and Product Owner. See the above point about the Scrum Master coaching the Product Owner.
See if anyone states that long-term planning is not part of the Scrum theory you should challenge them and give them the Scrum Guide to read.
What can be changed during a Sprint? Often customers have heated discussions what can be changed during a sprint. Here a clear statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the Sprint:
* No changes are made that would affect the Sprint Goal;
* Development Team composition and quality goals remain constant; and,
* Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_measured_in_a_burn_down_chart">What is measured in a burn down chart?</h3>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrum does not consider the time spent working on Sprint Backlog Items.
The work remaining and date are the only variables of interest.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only relevant information is the amount of work still open and when this work will be completed.
This is true for sprint, release and whole backlog burn-down chart.
I am glad that these precisions were added to the new version of the Scrum guide.
I simplify my daily work.
I can now simply refer the official Scrum Guide to convince people how aspects of Scrum should be understood.
The older version of the Scrum Guide is still relevant because it contains hints and best practices no more part of the new version.</p>

<p>I worked with quite a few Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and Scrum teams.

A Scrum Master is under huge stress being a development team member and having to balance their Scrum Master responsibilities against the commitment of the sprint goals.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>So you shall have full-time Scrum Masters.
More important is that you have real Scrum Masters, and not only Scrum administrators who organize meetings and manage the Scrum board and burn-down charts.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am often told that it is difficult to use Agile/Scrum approaches for brown field projects or for big projects or for distributed projects or for in other situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interestingly, these people also state that the same problems exist with traditional approaches such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenUP">RUP/OpenUP</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall Model</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model_(software_development)">V Model</a> defined as a formal standard in Germany <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Modell_(Entwicklungsstandard)">V-Modell Entwicklungsstandard</a>, and the Swiss variant called <a href="https://www.hermes.admin.ch/en">Hermes</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agile approaches are currently the standard for new projects and are thought in technical universities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrum is the main agile method and state of the industry approach for the implementation of software projects.</p>
</div>

<p>To open the discussion and bring the discussion back to objective arguments I often recommend the following books</p>

<p>I learnt quite a few new acronyms and techniques when studying for the PMI-ACP certification program.
In this post I collected these acronyms, some definition and the bibliography you should know before attending the examination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main advantage of having it is that you no longer need to argue with PMI certified product managers if agile is applicable to software projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main interest of PMI-ACP certification is their collection of concepts taken from Agile, eXtreme Programming, Scrum and Lean.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It could be worth your money to buy the book &#34;The PMI-ACP Exam: How to pass on Your First Try&#34;, Andy Crowe, First Edition 2012.
The book itself is not rocket science, but it contains two hundred questions which are similar to the ones you will encounter during the examination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get your 21 PDUs necessary for the examination you must attend a training course.
I booked an online course at Simplilearn for a reasonable price.
The content was reasonable.
The test questions were good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The renewal of the certification again requires PDUs.
I took online training in interesting areas such as coaching techniques, how to manage effective and efficient meetings or how to write good protocols.
Some online videos of <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog">Mike Cohn</a> also count for PDUs.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Who is the most appropriate person to monitor all the risks in an Agile product? <em>The product manager</em></p>
</li>

<p>Which of the following is false about Velocity? <em>Velocity cannot correct Estimation errors</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of the following is NOT the skill for Agile coaches for facilitating change? <em>Reaching agreement</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which tool combines the estimation techniques of expert opinion, disaggregation and analogy?
<em>Planning poker combines expert opinion, analogy, and disaggregation into an enjoyable approach to estimating that results in quick but reliable estimates.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of the following metrics can be BEST standardized across teams?
<em>Business case realization -The PMO can help the teams to enable timely decision making by standardizing the metrics.-</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which is the communication technique where you repeat back a summary of what the other person just said to you to confirm understanding?
<em>Reflective Listening is a communication technique where you repeat back a summary of what the other person just said to you to confirm understanding.</em>
<em>Another benefit in this situation is that having the person hear their own ideas in another person’s voice/words may make it easier for them to be objective.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adaptation depends upon understanding a wide range of information, including an assessment of the product’s progress, technical risks, the requirements
evolution, and ongoing competitive market analysis. Which are the areas where every team needs to constantly evaluate and make appropriate adaptations?
<em>Product Value, Product quality, Product status, Team performance -Every team needs to constantly evaluate and make appropriate adaptations in the following four areas - Product Value, Product quality, Product status, Team performance-</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A standard for measuring or evaluating something. <em>Metric - A metric is a standard for measuring or evaluating something.-</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What BEST describes the characteristics of a Learner at Level 3 or in the Fluent stage of learning?
Learners in the Fluent stage are experts -The Stage 3 Learner is at the stage of mastery.
He is able to figure out the end effect of any procedure and to make his way to that end.-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scrum uses the sashimi technique to require that every slice of functionality created by the developers be complete.
All the requirements gathering and analysis, design work, coding, testing, and documentation that constitute a complete product are required to be completed
in every Sprint and demonstrated in the Sprint increment of functionality. Sprints are kept short enough that the stakeholders don’t lose interest in the
product before the Sprints are completed. And stakeholders can see that they have an opportunity to redirect the product at the start of every Sprint to
optimize the value they derive from the product. At the end of every Sprint, stakeholders see new functionality. Models, requirements, and internal
artefacts might be of use to the developers, but they are never shown to the stakeholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feature X has a value of 12 and the total value of all features is 35. If the feature is estimated to cost 56%, what is the priority of this feature using
relative weighting?
<em>Correct Answer is B. The priority of the feature is determined by dividing the relative value by the cost %. Hence the answer = (12/35)/(0.56) = 0.61.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 100-Point Method was originally developed by Dean Leffingwell and Don Widrig for use cases and is used for prioritization as well.
It is a voting scheme where each stakeholder is given 100 points that he or she can use for voting in favour of the most important requirements.
How they distribute the 100 points is up to them: 20 here, 10 there or even all 100 on a single requirement if that is their sole priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a team member approaches the Coach with a complaint about another team member, what conflict resolution technique should the Coach use?
<em>Three-step intervention path</em>
Every team needs to constantly evaluate and make appropriate adaptations in the following four areas: Product value, Product quality, Team performance,
Project status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Normative methodologies are based on solutions or sequences of steps known to work for the discipline.
Electrical and other building codes in house wiring are examples.
In software development, one would include state diagram verification in this category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterative development means that we build a partial version of a product and then expand that version through successive short time periods of development
followed by reviews and adaptations. Feature-based delivery means that the engineering team builds features of the final product or, particularly with
industrial products. At least a close representation of the final product (such as a simulation model). Iterations are constrained to produce a result within
a certain period of time—a time box (as short as 1–4 weeks for software). Time boxes force closure; they force us to make something concrete, often before
we are quite ready. Incremental development means that we build these products such that they could be deployed at the end of one or more of the iterations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forecasting the financial value of a theme is the responsibility of the product owner, but it is a responsibility shared with all other team
members—programmers, testers, analysts, product managers, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decision Framing focuses majorly on,
<em>Decision framing focuses on who gets involved in the decision process.</em>
<em>Managers who make decisions without input from subordinates and peers make poor decisions.</em>
<em>Engineers who make decisions without input from managers and peers make poor decisions.</em>
<em>Who makes the decision is less important than getting the right people involved in the decision process.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of the following charts shows the total number of story points completed through the end of each iteration? <em>Cumulative story point burn-down chart</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During a critical problem-solving, you can ask probing questions, use active and reflective listening, Lead to an answer, but one should avoid injecting their
own ideas.</p>

<p>The trend is a clear move toward agile approaches.
Companies seem less reluctant to introduce agile approaches.
Major opponents such as senior managers or internal and external customers more and more acknowledge the success of agile approaches.
The two first identified hurdles still reflect the difficulty of changes at company level.
They are also the main reasons why a Scrum introduction fails in Swiss companies for my experience.
Too often, companies revert to some Waterfall/Hermes process or worst to a so-called internal ad-hoc method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We wrote in previous blogs that introducing Scrum in the development department or in the whole company is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management">change process</a>.
The coaches should be trained in change management and have experiences with resistance to changes.</p>

<p>The Scrum Master is of tremendous importance.
You need a skilled and enthusiastic Scrum Master; avoid Scrum Administrator.
Ken and Jeff have a clear idea who is in charge of this.</p>

<p>What are the main hurdles to introduce agile approaches in Swiss companies?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Introducing agile company-wide is a cultural change process. Such a change takes time and sometimes hurts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without commitment of senior management, the initiative will fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doubt that lean or agile works, doubt you can find agile experts, doubt that your projects can be realised with agile approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end, what matters are collaborator purpose, customer satisfaction,  business value.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below some findings of the study.</p>

<h3 id="_major_hurdles_when_introducing_agile_approaches">Major Hurdles When Introducing Agile Approaches</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>95%: Capabilities to handle organizational changes and the culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>39%: Overall resistance against changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>37%: Availability of skilled collaborators in the area of agile approaches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>34%: Projects are too big or too complex</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>31%: Resistance for the internal or external customer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28%: Missing support of senior management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>25%: Doubts that agile approaches do scale</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>23%: No resources or time for sustainable changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>9%: Costs reasons</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We wrote on blogs that introducing Scrum in the development department or in the whole company is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management">change process</a>.
The coaches should be trained in change management and have experiences with resistance to changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above points in italics are all related to changing processes.
You can handle two thirds of the hurdles with adequate change management training and a clear change product definition.
Do not try to introduce Scrum at company level without such an approach.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We wrote in previous <a href="../../2016/scrum-master-is-a-full-time-role">Scrum master is a full time job</a> that the Scrum Master is of tremendous importance.
You need a skilled and enthusiastic Scrum Master; avoid Scrum Administrator.
The new version of the Scrum guide clearly stated who is responsible for the introduction of the Scrum approach in the company?
Often people state that the management should spread Scrum in the company. Ken and Jeff have a clear idea who is in charge of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Leading</strong> and <strong>coaching</strong> the organization in its Scrum adoption;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Planning</strong> Scrum implementations within the organization;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team; and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Working</strong> with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the Scrum Master is a main driver for the introduction of Scrum in all departments and levels in the company.
He needs senior management support, but the Scrum Master’s daily job is to spread Scrum in the company.</p>

<p>Well, my current experience is that the answer is a sounding <strong>YES</strong>.</p>

<p>Developers love to develop software products using <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a>.
The motivation and positive energy just explode.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stakeholders love Scrum.
Every two weeks they have a new application version they can use, test, and get feedback from all users.
This is the dream of every key account manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because a new release is available every two weeks, the stakeholders should also provide feedback every two weeks.
They sometimes hate the pressure of agile and Scrum.</p>

<h3 id="_developers_team">Developers Team</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agile methods - Scrum, XP - are fun for all developers.
Suddenly, everyone can see your code, so at the beginning you as a developer must cope with different views how good code should be written.
Suddenly, you must master Test Driven Development TDD, mocking, unit test, legible documents.
But, once you have it, you start to experience the &#34;flow&#34; and enjoy the atmosphere and to deliver at the end of each sprint a new software artifact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later, you realize that Scrum says the team is responsible.
You must acknowledge that product success is also your success.
Each design decision is now also driven by ROI considerations.
If you master these responsibilities, you suddenly discover the world of engineering.
It is creating great products with an optimal balance of external quality and costs without ever jeopardizing the quality of the core.
You can never again deny that you as a developer are in charge.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scrum_master">Scrum Master</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum master [<a href="#mastering-professional-scrum">1</a>] is cool with a team enjoying Scrum and the flow of success.
You just have to realize you are not a master but the enabler of a team of talented engineers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So you need to discover your <em>the lonely cowboy riding in the sun</em> song why this job is so rewarding.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_product_owner">Product Owner</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a product owner [<a href="#professional-product-owner">2</a>], you control the budget of the product, the priorities.
At the end of each iteration you can change all priorities and goals.
Cool isn’t it.
But wait as a product owner, I am responsible for the budget and product success and each time a member of the team asks me something I must have an answer ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrum is cool and we enjoy it.
And Scrum makes everything transparent and fast.
Every two weeks, a new version is delivered.
This version must be evaluated, accepted or a list of improvements must be provided in the next few days.
This rhythm is fast, really fast.
Once you are up to this speed, you will enjoy the flow.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lessons_learnt">Lessons Learnt</h3>

<p>Middle management often struggles with the agile approach at the beginning.
See for example the discussion about <a href="https://less.works/less/management/index.html">manager role in an agile environment</a> in the <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> approach.
Be assured the results are worth the effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reading experience report or digging in the findings of Kotter, you realize success or failure goes through how you handle middle management.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> and agile mantra is to have a <em>ready to ship</em> product each time a sprint is completed.
You must avoid any incomplete activities at any price.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Incomplete activities are also called <em>Undone Work</em>.
They are technical debts in your software, hindering its delivery to users.
They are expended money you cannot invoice to your customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regulatory and traditional quality insurance departments request all kinds of documents, such as review, test results, risk analysis matrix.
They want insurance that their view of quality is fulfilled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrum sees the importance of quality like the lean production approach [<a href="#scrum-pocket-guide-3rd">1</a>].
Quality is built into the product.
You do not need any documents proving you have fulfilled this goal.
Your sole goal is to optimize the process to produce the best products, not to repair them after production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is the sole responsibility of the Scrum team to guaranty the quality of their product [<a href="#mastering-professional-scrum">2</a>].
Scrum teams also learnt you cannot win against big corporations.
So you have to define solutions satisfying the QA departments with minimal overhead and almost no undone work.
We have experience working with quality insurance and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technischer_%C3%9Cberwachungsverein">TUV</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration">FDA</a> driven regulatory departments.
We use the following approaches to handle the needs of the regulatory departments, seen as stakeholders in the Scrum terminology.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use static analysis tools such as <a href="https://pmd.github.io/">PMD</a>, <a href="https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/">Checkstyle</a>, <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/">Findbugs</a>
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> to create quality gate reports for your QA department.
Thousands of checks and hundreds of pages of reports will satisfy any QA department.
Plugins exist for <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> and continuous integration servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use review plugin such as Eclipse Jupiter to create these still mandatory review reports on the source code.
These reports are useless in an agile team working with techniques such as refactoring and pair programming.
But they are still mandatory for most of traditional quality assurance <em>QA</em> departments.
The plugin allows you to generate nice looking reports and to implement the findings at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> approach and create a lot of unit tests.
By slightly extending the logging features of JUnit and by using code coverage tools you can create reports showing which source code was tested.
Add some annotations to your test cases, and you have full traceability to your stories and associated software requirements.
With a small amount of work you can generate thousands of pages of information and provide the PDF documents to the regulatory department.
These documents are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technischer_%C3%9Cberwachungsverein">TUV</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration">FDA</a> compliant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">Behavior Driven Development</a> approach and create acceptance criteria for all your stories.
Using the reporting features of <a href="https://easyb.io/">easyb</a>, you can create acceptance test reports for all your stories.
It generates hundreds of pages of information and provides the PDF documents to the regulatory department.
These documents are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technischer_%C3%9Cberwachungsverein">TUV</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration">FDA</a> compliant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use continuous integration servers to run all the above measures and generate the documentation at the end of each sprint or release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Link you version control system with your continuous server, issue tracking system and unit tests.
So you can generate release notes stating the list of closed issues with the associated source code and unit tests verifying the correctness of the change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar tools are available in Python .NET, or C++ communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can easily satisfy your QA and regulatory stakeholders with a lot of reports nobody will ever read.
A real <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> team corrects weaknesses during the development process and always deliver software of the highest quality.
The reports can only show the inherent quality of the software and are not worth the paper they are printed on.
But you satisfy powerful stakeholder groups and can more freely work on the most important goal.
Deliver on time and in budget the best software the customer wants to have.</p>
