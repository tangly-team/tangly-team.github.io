      <title>Domain-Driven Design with ROS-2</title>

      <description>At its core, Robot Operation System provides a message-passing system, often called middleware.&#xA;Communication is one of the first needs to arise when implementing a new robot application, or really any software system that will interact with hardware. ROSâ€™s built-in and well-tested messaging system saves you time by managing the details of communication between distributed nodes via an anonymous Publish and Subscribe Pattern.&#xA;This approach encourages good practices in your software development, including fault isolation, Seperation of Concerns, and clear interfaces.</description>

      <title>Agile Architecture Questions</title>
      <link>https://blog.tangly.net/blog/2024/agile-architecture-questions/</link>

      <description>Agile architecture means how enterprise architects, system architects and software architects apply architectural practice in agile software development.&#xA;An agile architect should handle a regular set of questions for each application he is working on.&#xA;Each digital product encounters similar requirements and shall provide good solutions for the most acute restrictions.&#xA;The goal is to define an evolvable minimal architecture. New functional and non-functional requirements shall be realized with minimal changes in the design.</description>

      <title>Document Your Agile Architecture</title>
      <link>https://blog.tangly.net/blog/2024/document-your-agile-architecture/</link>

      <description>The overwhelming success of agile approaches to create digital products has implications on our work techniques.&#xA;Design emerges. The team learns incrementally and refines the solution [1].&#xA;Agile architecture is a collaborative and iterative process.&#xA;Agile methods do not require comprehensive documentation at the beginning. Managers do not need to plan months in advance because things can change as the project evolves.&#xA;The idea is to produce documentation with information that is essential to move forward when it makes the most sense.</description>

      <description>The actor library defines the actor abstraction with mailboxes and concrete implementation for various target platforms.&#xA;The CMSIS-RTOS v2 platform provides an actor implementation for all realtime kernels supporting the CMSIS API. The API is under the stewardship of ARM company.&#xA;Any kernel with a CMSIS-RTOS v2 compatible layer is eligible.&#xA;STM provides the CMSIS integration with freeRTOS for all STM32 microcontrollers.&#xA;Library The library defines key abstractions as abstract classes [1] [2].</description>

      <description>There is a strong need for higher-level frameworks ensuring safe concurrent programming.&#xA;The Actor Model is one of the best approaches to safe concurrency and legible code [1]. The model is based on Message Passing.&#xA;Although multiple actors can run at the same time, an actor will process a given message sequentially. This means that if you send three messages to the same actor, it will just execute one at a time.</description>

      <description>The daily Scrum meeting is a key event for the development team.&#xA;It is a time-boxed event of maximum 15 minutes.&#xA;The developers find out if the Sprint Goal is still achievable and what are the identified impediments to be tackled.&#xA;Often the collaborators use the meeting to synchronize their work and to plan the day.&#xA;It is a great opportunity to ask questions and to learn from each other.</description>

      <description>Concurrent programming has always been tricky. Accessing a shared state from multiple threads is a central problem, where hard-to-catch errors may easily appear.&#xA;Protected access to identified shared variables is easy to realize. Mechanisms to avoid deadlocks or starvation are cumbersome to implement and almost impossible to validate.&#xA;The need for concurrent programming has increased tremendously with the fact that all modern processors and many microcontrollers have multiple cores.</description>

      <description>You are creating the next digital software masterpiece.&#xA;How can you document your software architecture in a way that is useful for your team and stakeholders?&#xA;A software architecture document SAD is a document that describes the structure of a software solution.&#xA;It includes the architecture of its components, the relationships between those components, and the principles that guide its design.&#xA;The solution architecture document is typically used as a reference for designing, building, and maintaining a software system.</description>

      <description>The Java community releases a new version every six months. This is a good thing, it means that the language is evolving at a steady pace.&#xA;New language features are added in each release. Much effort is put into improving the performance of the JVM and solving small issues.&#xA;The community provides beta releases for developers to test and provide feedback during the six months before the next release. You have the possibility and time to migrate and test your code before the official release.</description>

      <title>Structure Your Concurrency</title>

      <description>Writing concurrent software is one of the greatest challenges for software developers [1, 2].&#xA;A professional software developer must understand the principles of concurrent programming and the tools available to write concurrent software.&#xA;Only concurrent applications can access all cores of modern multicore processors and provide the best performance.&#xA;Java thread model makes it a strong contender among concurrent languages, but multithreading has always been inherently tricky.&#xA;The introduction of virtual threads empowered Java to provide a unique and highly-optimized threading system that is also easy to understand.</description>

      <description>What are statecharts, also called hierarchical state machines?&#xA;Put simply, a statechart is a beefed-up state machine [1] [2]. The syntax is formally defined in the UML standard.&#xA;The beefing up solves a lot of the problems that state machines have, especially state explosion that happens as state machines grow.&#xA;We explain below what statecharts are and how they are useful.&#xA;Statecharts offer a surprising array of benefits:&#xA;It is easier to understand a statechart than many other forms of code.</description>

      <description>Java 9 introduces a new level of abstraction above packages, known as the Java Platform Module System JPMS, or Modules for short [1].&#xA;Modules emphasize at compilation time modern software engineering principles such as encapsulation, and modularity [2, 3, 4].&#xA;Java 9 was released in September 2017.&#xA;Most Java developers are still not using this powerful and elegant construct to modularize their applications.&#xA;Modules A module is a group of closely related Java packages and resources along with a new module descriptor file.</description>

      <description>The Java Stream API is a powerful and simple to understand set of tools for processing sequences of elements. The standard collections were retrofitted with the stream() method, which allows us to convert any collection to a stream.&#xA;Modern Java code has almost no loops and conditional statements. It relies on the Stream API and the functional programming style to implement algorithms.&#xA;When used properly, it allows us to reduce a huge amount of boilerplate code, create more readable programs, and improve productivity [1, 2].</description>

      <description>Eclipse Store [1] is a Java-native persistence layer built for cloud-native microservices and serverless systems. EclipseStore is the only data storage solution that uses the native Java object model instead of database-specific structure or format.&#xA;It enables storing any Java object graph of any size and complexity transaction-safe into any binary data storage such as plain files, persistent volumes, or cloud object storage.&#xA;Snapshots of the object graph differences are regularly saved to the storage.</description>

      <description>Records, sealed types, enumerations are the key language features for Algebraic Data Types.&#xA;The features have been available since Java 17.&#xA;Latter JDK releases provide additional capabilities and syntactic sugar.&#xA;Based on the features of JDK 22, we are still missing with constructors for records and primitive support for pattern matching [1].&#xA;Pattern matching capabilities empower the developer to implement complex algorithms in a compact and legible way.&#xA;Patterns such as visitor pattern are obsolete.</description>
