</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often, teams discuss if their digital product should upgrade to the current version of open-source or commercial used components.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same discussion arises for development tools and programming language versions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have a <strong>strong opinion</strong> about upgrades.
You should always use the current version of all components included in your product.
The only discussion is the timely <strong>when</strong> and never the <strong>if</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be realist, if your product is successful, you have to upgrade before the components are obsolete.
Otherwise, your application will become a geriatric solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Organizations often forget the liability of using older versions of components with known and published security flaws
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below I provide you with arguments why you should always update all components in a timely fashion.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_security_and_governance">Security and Governance</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Social responsibility and liability considerations require your product to be immune to published attacks.
Your company shall provide reasonable protection to all your customers.
Therefore, you always include security patches in your product in a timely manner.
Other approaches are deeply unprofessional and unethical.
In some countries, you are liable if you do not update your software to avoid known security attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should use actual Java JDK and JVM version because the community is concentrating their effort on the latest version.
Oracle only provides public support for the latest two Java versions, e.g. in January 2018, Java 9 and Java 8 are officially supported.
Java 8 support will stop end of September 2018, older versions are no more publicly maintained.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If, for some reasons, you are using an older commercially but no more publicly supported JDK, you must sign a support contract with the Oracle company and pay for it.
You cannot use deprecated JDK versions because nobody provides security fixes on these versions - e.g. Java 6 commercial support ended in December 2017 –.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you include a deprecated JDK / JVM in your product, you willingly endanger your users and shall be liable for their losses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Governments started to realize how unprofessional organizations are working.
Recommendations and laws are grafted to force better security
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_upgrades_and_genuine_improvements">Upgrades and Genuine Improvements</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The component developers put tremendous effort to improve the non-functional aspects of their products.
Performance and scalability improvements between Java versions are impressive.
You shall not hinder your own customers to rip these low-hanging fruits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actual versions of standards - Unicode, HTTP protocol, time zones - help eliminate incompatibilities and subtle errors from use cases.
Having older versions will hinder you to support actual timezone changes or extensions in the Unicode standard.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_training_and_community_support">Training and Community Support</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good training and associated certification are only available for actual versions of languages, frameworks or library.
You will not find any training for Ada, Apache server 1.x, or any object-oriented database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The articles in Stack Overflow and the community always cover the current version of components.
So you are on your own for support or code examples for older versions of libraries.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_hidden_cost_of_backport">Hidden Cost of Backport</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Writing code for older versions of libraries, frameworks or runtimes means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backporting">backporting</a> to older application interfaces and features.
For example, if you do not have access to auto-closable resources, you have to write your own framework and software checks guarantying closing system resources.
You should always free system resources in your application.
The literature states this is neither easy nor error free.
It is the root reason why such a feature was added to Java.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Teams often forget the consequences of back porting.
Later, when you adopt a more modern version of your dependencies, you have to remove all this now spurious code and migrate to the build-in concept.
Otherwise, the code is no more maintainable and changes are error-prone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, you have to twice work when backporting, once to build it in, and a second time to later remove it.
This solution is certainly not the most economical one.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_motivation_of_team">Motivation of Team</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No professional developer wants to write source code using JDK 7 or older versions.
They want to develop using modern and powerful constructs such as lambda, modules, HTTP/2.
I would state that not using such constructs disqualifies you as a professional engineer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We observed how whole teams become demotivated because a huge part of their daily work was backporting to old environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I understand that geriatric software solutions do not allow you to use the latest versions.
It is time to bury such products and to go on.
The only open question is the date of the burial.
Do not wait too long, decomposition is never nice to smell.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maintaining or extending software based on old versions of libraries is just throwing money out the window.
You need a solid basement to build on.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most successful projects I worked for had selected the money dimension seen as investment budgets.
Goals correction were communicated early and the contract amended accordingly.
We avoided complicated and expensive change request processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The build products were very successful.
We respected the agreed budget and were timely.
The dynamic was in the scope definition.
We delivered early and often high quality increments so the end users could adjust their expectations and refine their needs.</p>

<p>Agile will never guarantee product success.
All projects, especially application development, entail risk.
If a product was risk-free, it is unlikely to provide significant benefits or competitive advantages.
There are a number of ways in which Agile Scrum projects repeatedly fail which are worth examining.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agile approaches and Scrum framework can reduce risks in projects and increase the return on investment.
<a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/standish-chaos-2015">Standish Group report</a> is a proof of this statement.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are common patterns and errors when doing agile instead of being agile</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Wagile</dt>
<dd>
<p>is a team which continues to follow basically a Waterfall product but uses the language of Agile and adds a few agile practices.
For example, the team may present burn-down charts together with Gantt charts.
Or the team computes individual resource allocation for the next three months.
You can also replace Waterfall with V-Model, <a href="http://www.hermes.admin.ch/onlinepublikation/index.xhtml">HERMES</a>, RUP, and even sometimes <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">ScrumBut</dt>
<dd>
<p>describes a team which claims to follow Scrum but misses various practices.
For example, <em>We do Scrum but we don’t have a Product Owner</em>.
Or <em>We do <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> but the Project Manager allocates tasks</em>.
Such teams normally have a long list of “buts” and show little progress of removing them.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Hitting The Scrum Wall</dt>
<dd>
<p>The most popular Agile method is Scrum which is a product management technique.
Scrum is normally used with a number of other Agile techniques, typically user stories redaction and the technical practices from <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> – such as TDD, ATDD, code refactoring, continuous integration and delivery CI/CD, pair programming, etc.
Teams that adopt the Scrum framework initially see an improvement in productivity and customer satisfaction.
Without technical practices, quality is low, and the team hit the wall.
The quality gap makes it impossible to maintain the pace in the long run.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Fake Agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>occurs when a team declares itself Agile and blames everyone else for their failure to interact correctly with the group.
Such a group typically stops writing documentation, listening to business analysts, product managers and other customers, and dictates its own delivery schedule.
Meanwhile, the team does not improve quality, does not adopt test driven development or any other practice they dislike.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Potemkin Agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>occurs when a team adopts and applies an Agile method well but does not deliver business value.
This is a form of goal deferment were the team consider adhering to the process rather than delivering business value as the success criteria.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Customer (Business Analyst, Product Manager, Product Owner) overload</dt>
<dd>
<p>on a well-functioning Agile product the customer, or proxy customer, is called upon to do a lot.
They need to decide requirements, set priorities, scout ahead of the product, align strategy, work with the developers, testers and managers, and may even have their own day job to do.
In the earliest XP product (“C3”) the first business analyst came close to a nervous breakdown.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Fall back</dt>
<dd>
<p>Management may bring in consultants and other experts help switch a team to Agile.
Once the consultants leave some teams return to their old ways of working.
Advisers and consultants can be a great help when introducing Agile.
They need to build capacity in the development team to continue learning and evolving when the consultants are gone.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Failure to go far enough</dt>
<dd>
<p>To maximise the benefits of Agile Software Development the people, processes and organization that interface and work with the Agile team needs to understand Agile and adjust their expectations and working techniques too.
Agile is not a drop-in technology that can be swapped in to replace another failing method.
Isolated Agile teams will find it difficult to be completely Agile.
When other groups adopt agile approaches, the benefits of Agile can spread beyond Software Development.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Exploding cards</dt>
<dd>
<p>happens when teams do not sufficiently understand the technology they are working with – either in the solution or problem domain.
Small work packages suddenly turn out to be large tasks in their own right.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Hyper changing requirements</dt>
<dd>
<p>Most Agile methods, especially Scrum, hold the iteration goals fixed for a few weeks.
An exception is Kanban.
Most businesses should be able to hold to goals for such short periods of time.
If it proves impossible to hold requirements and goals fixed for even one week, then something is wrong.
In a few cases, business is genuinely changing extremely rapidly.
In this case, teams are better off using Kanban style management than a Scrum-based approach.
More often, hyper change in goals and requirements are a sign that something is wrong beyond the team.
The organization itself may lack strategy and objectives, or the Product Owner may not be filling their role adequately.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Fragile, not Agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>Some Agile techniques, like TDD, ATDD, CI or CD, when poorly applied with a lack of understanding can show short-term benefits but create long-term problems.</p>
</dd>

Each MVC has a hypothesis about how to improve an aspect of your organization or your team.
It has measurements – often called KPI by management – to decide if the change was a worthy improvement.

<p>I believe that the right mindset is boosted by good practice, just as good practice cannot be achieved without the correct mindset.
When advising others, I spend much of my time trying to connect practice with mindset, as they are symbiotic.
You truly need both.</p>

<p>Choose wisely your coaches.
Check they can coach at technical, team and organization level.

<p>It is time to throw a big party in Switzerland.
More than 60% of all projects are now realised using an agile approach (to see Agile Trends in Switzerland 2017] by
<a href="http://swissq.it/en/agile/">SwissQ</a>), Scrum being the most popular one, Kanban as the second one.
What a change in just one year.
In 2016, we had 40% of projects being agile, one year later we have 60%.
<em>Time to adapt and become agile</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was a long journey.
At the beginning of this millennium, I was convincing managers that agile is not evil and could be used in Switzerland.
Yes, agile is compatible with Swiss culture - we finally added <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> to the national methodology
<a href="http://www.hermes.admin.ch/onlinepublikation/index.xhtml?element=supportingmaterial_hinweis_agiles_projektmanagement_mit_hermes_und_scrum.html">Hermes</a> -.
The report 2016 patently states that agile projects are more successful for the customer and the company than non-agile ones.
It is genuinely time to adapt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See our previous blogs for the results of <a href="../../2017/agile-trends-switzerland-2016">Agile Trends Switzerland 2012</a>,
<a href="../../2016/agile-trends-switzerland-2012">Agile Trends Switzerland 2012</a>, and <a href="../../2016/agile-trends-switzerland-2013">Agile Trends Switzerland 2013</a>.
They illustrate the slow gains of agile and lean approaches in our country.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have a strong <em>déjà-vu</em>.
I am now convincing managers that agile approaches for the whole company are not evil and could be used in Europe and Switzerland.
Yes, agile approaches are compatible with European and Swiss cultures.
Yes, holistic agile approaches increase the odds of success to deliver tremendous products to our customers.
Again, I heard the same arguments as 15 years ago why our companies are different and need special approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To ripe the benefits of agile approaches, it is now time to transition whole departments and the company.
I hope to succeed in the first half of this century.</p>

<h3 id="_major_hurdles_introducing_agile_approaches">Major Hurdles Introducing Agile Approaches</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The major hurdles when introducing agile approaches at department/company level are</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Current company culture</dt>
<dd>
<p><a href="http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior">First change the structure</a>, it enables
<a href="http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior">cultural change</a>.
Quite a few companies try to change their culture without altering their structure.
It is doomed to fail.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Existing company structure and frozen hierarchies</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is time to rethink your structure and move decision power to the teams, near to the customers,</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Controlling not tailored to agile approaches</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is difficult to be slightly agile.
The same can be said about lean.
Either you are lean, agile or you are not.
Try <a href="http://bbrt.org/">Beyond Budgeting Round Table</a>,</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Overall processes are not tailored to agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once you change your structure and hierarchy, the processes will evolve.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Trust is missing</dt>
<dd>
<p>Here again we talk again about trust, or the beliefs your collaborators are competent and do their best to achieve success.
As an organization and as a manager, it is time to decide.
Do you truly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_Theory_Y">trust</a> your collaborators?</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Customers are not involved or engaged</dt>
<dd>
<p>Customers are the center in the new world.
Please involve them, talk to them, find out what they need.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could also say organizations are still struggling with <em>Being agile, not doing agile</em>.
Avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_our_recommendations">Our Recommendations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You shall start introducing agile approaches at department and company level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Senior management is fully committed to the approach and approves the cultural change.
Read the book &#34;Reinventing Organizations&#34; from Frederic Laloux to understand the implied changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Train your managers to understand agile, lean, and customer-centric approaches.
Training is not a half-day introduction, it is days and days of training, workshops, and reading.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transition is painful, see the seminal articles of Steve Denning:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2015/01/26/why-do-managers-hate-agile">Why do managers hate agile?</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2015/01/28/more-on-why-managers-hate-agile">More on why managers hate agile</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The principles are</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Products are value-driven and quality oriented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams are focused to master their work and tools – Craftsmanship, <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For huge development departments consider using the <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams work best if you can answer with a deafening yes to these five questions.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Psychological safety: Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependability: Can we count on each other to do high-quality work on time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structure &amp; clarity: Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meaning of work: Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impact of work: Do we fundamentally believe that the work we are doing matters?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have doubts, please refrain from using agile and lean methods.
Introducing agile approaches in product development is similar to introducing lean principles in a production environment.
Either you do it fully or the benefits are marginal.
Worst the best employees will see through and probably leave due to unkept promises.</p>

Remember <em>Defect Driven Development</em> to guaranty your customer.
He will never again see the same issue.</p>

<p>Check that your specification also has acceptance criteria which can be automated.</p>

<p>For Microsoft developers, are you forced to use TFS instead of tools of your choice and why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you testers and quality experts integrated into your Scrum team and sitting in the same room?
Do you think about tester and quality as roles and not people?</p>

Scrum teams try to be fully cross-functional and invest a lot of effort to reach this goal.
They probably do it because it is written in all Scrum tutorials.
Every person should be able to take a task from the Scrum board and implement it.

Scrum is about agility.
Therefore, you have the right to change anything at any time, isn’t it?
Your stakeholders need the changes now.
They cannot wait until the end of the sprint, a mere ten working days or two weeks of elapsed time.
But Scrum also states we have a vision, features, a minimum viable product and a potentially shippable product.
How often can you change these key concepts?
What is the balance between agility and chaos?</p>

So teams state that - No architecture is needed before starting coding, - No enterprise architecture should be defined or look at, - No non-functional considerations are needed.
Look at the picture.
Could you design a village without knowing about the ground, the kind of population, do you need school, do they have a flood in the area?
They believe that refactoring will solve all the problems.
Architects are no more needed, we are all talented hackers.</p>
