</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>None of the government solutions provide modern API.
We still must manually input our data in their portals.
The old interfaces they provide are only partially available through expensive commercial solutions.
By old interfaces we mean proprietary formats and proprietary file transfer solutions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_findings">Findings</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last four years were a game changer.
A lot of manual activities are now fully digitized and often automatized.
We never had to buy a printer.
The last year we seldom had to scan a paper document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The partners still requesting paper interactions are some government agencies and some insurances.
We observe a decrease of such physical interactions. Our partners are steadily - if sometimes slowly - digitizing their workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Slowly digital versions for invoices are emerging.
This approach should allow automated payment workflows.
Interestingly private customers already have billing and e-payment solutions.
Similar solutions for corporate customers are either not available or incredibly limited, cumbersome and expensive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next big step will be the emergence of API to integrate the steps in a workflow specific to the involved companies.
For example the technical part of the onboarding process for a new employee could be fully automated.</p>

<li>
<p>Spotify Model was popularized by Henrik Kniberg.
His YouTube videos are worth watching.
The banking group ING adopted the approach and made it fashionable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scrum@Scale defined by Jeff Sutherland and <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/">Scrum Alliance</a>.
Henrik Kniberg has written an interesting article stating Spotify Model is a kind of Scrum@Scale.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> 5.0 defined by the RUP aficionados and often trashed by Kniberg, Sutherland, Schwaber, Larmann and Vodde.
At the same it is the most popular approach in quite a few countries.

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Delay your Scaling.  First Lean the ropes.  Try to descale your processes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Learn the ropes</strong> with small agile teams applying <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban/">Kanban</a>, <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> or our own approach.
Learn as much as you can through experiments before considering scaling.
The invested capital in small experiments with small teams is tremendously cheaper than experimenting with company-wide approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be gentle and kind to your professional teams.
<strong>Scale once your agile teams are seasoned.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>It takes time to learn and master</strong> Scrum and Kanban approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Recognize that organizational agility is constrained by technical agility.</strong>
Focus the first years on technical excellence, software craftsmanship and clean development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the above-mentioned methods emphasize the importance of technical excellence for durable success.</p>

<p>Study the history and evolution of the various scaling approaches.
In particular the changes in <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a> are an archaeological treasury what they wrongly stated and how they corrected some identified flaws.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continuous delivery is the new approach.
Eliminate hardening iterations, integration phases, milestones when software should be integrated.
Your teams shall deliver a workable software on demand, multiple times a week or a day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Organize around products</em>.
Customers buy products.
Eliminate product based organizations.
*b <em>Have one backlog for the whole product</em>.
Multiple backlogs must be otherwise synchronized and local optimization is de facto applied.
This approach is against all lean principles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Customer and users talks directly with the development team</em>.
Product owners, product managers enterprise architects should never be filtering the information flow between customers and engineers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Eliminate step by step all coordination roles</em>.
Emphasize communication between developers in the team and between teams.
Scrum of Scrums where only Scrum masters attend, Release Train Engineer, System teams, corporate Solution Engineers are just a waste of resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Realize technical excellence is the only approach</em> to deliver quality products to the customer.
Raise the importance of technical excellence, and never forget that when writing software, the technology side is really vital.</p>

<p>Establish agile teams.
Thin your process.
Chose your scaling approach.
Try it and measure impact.
Iterate and improve continuously.
Therefore, it could be necessary to change your initial scaling approach and adapt it to your company needs.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When upgrading the choice you face is whether to use the latest version of Java, currently 13 and be prepared to upgrade every six months.
Or upgrade to the latest LTS 11 to give yourself up to three years to think about your next upgrade,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t be tempted to ignore compiler warnings.
Deprecation is being taken much more seriously in this modern Java world, and both Java 10 and Java 11 removed APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In less than two years the next LTS will be released with Java 17. It is scheduled in September 2021.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once over this first upgrade, it is worth at least testing the application on the latest version of Java every 6 months, for example in CI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In all cases openJDK is now the new default.
Various companies - Oracle, Redhat, Amazon, Azul, IBM - provide commercial support for openJDK for different timelines.
You are more flexible with your migration timeline.</p>

<h3 id="_how_to_migrate">How to Migrate?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You do not need to implement Java modules to migrate to Java 9 or beyond.
It is worth the effort to slowly support the module approach.
Your architecture will become more modular and the interfaces are more clearly defined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are basically four incremental phases to fully migrate to Java 11 or later:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Run an existing Java application with the JDK,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile the application with the JDK,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the new features of the current JDK,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modularize the application to use module system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could recompile and run your solution with the new Java version without code changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Changes are necessary if you use deprecated packages or access Sun internal packages.
All deprecated packages have a compatible alternate implementation.
Often you just need to update the import statements.
Sun packages have a documented migration path to alternate approaches providing similar functionality.
By the way Sun company already stated years ago you should not use these internal packages.
So it is time to clean up your code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_call_for_action">Call for Action</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Start now your migration to a modern JDK and leave Java 8 behind you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway you can only tinker with the date, you will have to migrate at some point.</p>

<p>Agile approaches encourage common ownership of artifacts during product development.
Historically, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons">commons</a> is the term used for shared resources.
Can we apply the commons learnings to agile and Scrum approaches?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interestingly, economists were kind to state common ownership is doomed to fail through the theory published end of the sixties <a href="#tradegy-commons">[1]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thirty years later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom">Elinor Ostrom</a> showed that commons can indeed work well if you follow a small set of rules.
She found century-old examples scattered around the world.
She was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for her findings in 2009 and dissipated the previous fake news.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The picture shows a <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suone">Suone</a> in Wallis, Switzerland.
The constructions bring water to arid regions and are build and maintained by communities.
It is an example of commons in place for hundreds of years and is one of the concrete implementation studied by Elinor.
Mountain pastures are also managed as commons in Switzerland.
You will find a drawing of Suone on the

<pre>A resource arrangement that works in practice can work in theory.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Elinor Ostrom identified eight design principles of stable local common pool resource management through the world.
These principles have a wider range of applications than common resource pool groups.
They are relevant to nearly any situation where people - such as Scrum teams - must cooperate and coordinate to achieve shared goals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below the eight principles are presented with a mapping to Scrum aspects.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum teams define the artifacts and processes exclusively owned by the team.
Teams take ownership of items such as source code, Scrum board, pull process.
Other items, such as refactoring process, incident tickets produce more infighting.
You can measure the maturity of your team accordingly to the clarity which resources they own exclusively.
The first step shall often be <em>collective ownership of source code</em> and <em>common coding style</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_appropriation_and_provision_of_common_resources_that_are_adapted_to_local_conditions">The appropriation and provision of common resources that are adapted to local conditions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agile teams own commons resources such as * <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeOwnership.html">Collective ownership of source code</a>, * Definition of Done DoD, * Sprint Backlog, * Coding Guidelines, * Team rules and work techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The work techniques often limit common resources in inexperienced teams.
They ask the product owner if they could refactor a class or invest a few minutes in clean code techniques.
They do not own the internal quality of the product.
More mature teams are able to make the transition with the support of their Scrum master and the organization.
They truly own the source code and its quality.</p>

<h3 id="_collective_choice_arrangements_that_allow_most_resource_appropriators_to_participate_in_the_decision_making_process">Collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> or <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> have quite a few platforms to support decision-making process * Daily Scrum, * Retrospective, * Review, * Backlog refinement, * Planning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The decision-making process works only if the organization grants psychological security to their teams.
In my experience, it takes years until an organization discards command and control reflexes and delegates responsibility and accountability to the Scrum team members.
Daily Scrum events are often reporting meetings.
The developers report either to the Scrum master, or the product owner, or a manager.
The events are seldom a platform to collaborate, discuss options and experiment with variants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consensus or consent approaches are widely more successful than majority decisions is one of the findings of Elinor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_effective_monitoring_by_monitors_who_are_part_of_or_accountable_to_the_appropriators">Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have to monitor your commons to know if they are healthy.
You can</p>

<div class="ulist">

<li>
<p>Pair program or review commits with pull requests,</p>

</li>
<li>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I regularly state monitoring is the first commitment of team members to be publicly accountable.
Often it is painful to realize how difficult transparency is.</p>

<h3 id="_a_scale_of_graduated_sanctions_for_resource_appropriators_who_violate_community_rules">A scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators who violate community rules</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rules are only respected if sanctions are implemented upon violations of the agreement.
Scrum teams can rule that</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You must repair the broken build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must immediately correct your coding violations.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>You are excluded from the team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most teams need counseling before they can tackle the concept of sanctions.
As a Scrum master you must gently empower them to sanction.
If this rule is not implemented, you will always land in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of commons</a> and utterly fail in your agile journey.
Worse, your product will probably also fail.</p>

<li>
<p>Daily Scrum,</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The automatic checks are worth the effort as an effective, neutral, and cost-effective to detect violations and automatically block the offender.
The Scrum events are platforms to discuss and resolve the discovered violations.
The Scrum master must facilitate the discussion until the team members have developed their own conflict resolution instruments.</p>

Here we leave the team level and need department recognition - for a LeSS approach - or company level recognition - for example to have ownership to remove a team member -.</p>

<p>Scrum and the <a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum Guide</a> are silent how architecture activities are performed during sprints.
We can use the Scrum values, the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum Guide</a> and the
<a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile Manifesto Principles</a> to infer approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The architect shall be part of the Scrum development team.
This is the most embedded way an architect would fit into a Scrum team.
It may not even be an individual who has the title of an architect.
The big idea behind Scrum teams is that team members have different skills.
Their roles may change to deliver what is required for a particular sprint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So it could be that senior developers within the team got architecture skills.
They are in the best position, or have the best knowledge, to make those architectural decisions.
Those team members with architectural skills are involved in the sprint on a day-to-day basis.
They attend the daily Scrum meetings, take items off the backlog, and work on them.</p>

<p>We have mentioned refactoring, which is how we evolve an ever-improving design and architecture while building the product incrementally.
To do that, we need to know the difference between good architecture and design and not-so-good.
We need a rich pool of architecture and design options in our bag of tricks, ranging from very simple options to the more complex and rich options that we may need as the system grows.
One never knows too much about the quality of architecture, code, and design.
One does, of course, need to apply that knowledge smoothly, incrementally, little by little.</p>

<p>By the way do you know that Edward Jenner is considered the founder of vaccinology in the West in 1796.

<p>Be honest.
Having a huge class with thousands of lines of code plainly demonstrates that your organization worked unprofessionally over months in the past.
Such monsters are not born over one night coding session.
It takes time and incompetence to create such maintenance nightmares.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As long as your product contains such code monsters, it is worthless to pretend to have a nice and thought through architecture.</p>

<p>If you are a Java developer you will * Use JUnit 5 and Mockito 2 to implement the first step, * Use a powerful IDE such an IntelliJ IDEA to write and enhance the functional code, * Use tools such as SonarLint, Jacoco, Spotbugs, ArchUnit to refactor your functional code and test cases.
Clean code applies to productive and test code.</p>

<h3 id="_acceptance_test_driven_development">Acceptance Test Driven Development</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do you know what are the requirements of a specific feature?
Either write a huge amount of outdated documentation or find a better way.
The better way is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_test%E2%80%93driven_development">acceptance test driven development</a> <em>ATDD</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For each feature, you need acceptance criteria; this approach is also called <em>specification by example</em>.
For each acceptance criteria write an acceptance test which is executed each time the application is updated in the continuous delivery pipeline.
The acceptance tests are the living documentation of the behavior of your product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To implement this approach you need</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Acceptance criteria which imply specifications by example - you need to train your business analysts and product owners,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cucumber for Java (or equivalent tools) - to write acceptance tests, Mock all external systems including the database.
You want to have fast build and test time and avoid external dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A continuous build and delivery pipeline to automatically run your acceptance validation tests upon each application change,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid user interface tests - because they are slow and brittle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an in-memory database only if you have to - they are a fast solution to write acceptance tests but are intrinsically slower than mocks.</p>

<p>Teams ready to learn from the like of Google could evaluate <a href="https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/">Trunk Based Development</a> and consider long-lived branches as waste.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_code_review">Code Review</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A code review can be done in different ways.
Many teams use GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab.
A very common approach for our code reviews is using merge requests.
However, there are situations where pull requests are not necessary.
For example, if a feature is implemented in pair programming or mob programming then the code is already reviewed while it is written.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We decided that it does not have to be reviewed again but of course, everybody may look at the commits later on in GitHub and add comments.
A rule of thumb we agreed upon is that every line of code has to be approved by at least one other developer before it is pushed into our master branch.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_pull_requests_in_trunk_based_development">Pull Requests in Trunk-Based Development</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In trunk-based development it is different.
Since we want to merge our commits into the master branch as quickly as possible, we cannot wait until the complete feature is finished.
Unlike in the original trunk-based development approach we still use feature branches, but we have much less divergence from the master branch than in Git Flow.
We create a pull request as soon as the first commit is pushed into the feature branch.
Of course, that requires that no commit breaks anything or causes tests to fail.
Remember that unfinished features can always be disabled with feature toggles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, with part of the new feature committed and the pull request created, another developer from the team can review it.
In most cases, that does not happen immediately because the developers don’t want to interrupt their work every time a team member pushes a commit.
Instead, the code reviews are done when another developer is open for it.
Meanwhile, the pull request might grow by a few commits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code is not always reviewed immediately after the commit.
In most cases it reaches the master branch much quicker than in Git Flow.</p>

<p>The major gains using macOS are * Still no virus scanner is necessary, the speed-up during complex programming and development activities is tremendous, * No trouble when updating OS, updates are automatic and often no new start is required, Unix command line and tools are available in the console.

<p>No virus scanner is still important.
I was lately at a customer site.

This decision just broke the CI/CD pipeline for hours.</p>

Analysis of various products found out that 5% to 10% of the source code is under active development.

<p>To understand team dynamics, you should group individual developers to their team.
Simply replace the name of the team member with the team name at the command line using grep or sed.
Now you can analyze the set of files the team mainly modifies and maintains.
If none can be found, you have diffuse code ownership and will have quality issues.</p>

<p>Agile approaches are not enough.
You need a strong engineering culture to achieve quality and lasting success.</p>

<p>Often, coaches and Scrum masters tinker with the processes and invest effort and blood to improve the ceremonies and the company structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But at the end of the day, the success of your application is defined by its adequacy to customers&#39; needs and its overall quality.
You need a solid and professional engineering culture to produce high-quality products and release them at high rate.
If not, you just release a new set of defects to your paying customers.</p>

<p>Values drive your culture and the daily behavior of all your collaborators.
But even if you have invested time and blood to identify the right values and put all the mechanisms in place, it might still not have the desired results.
Culture is something that happens daily through personal interactions.
Putting the right values and mechanisms in place will help move your company in the right direction, but it’s not a guaranty for success.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to increase your odds for success, you need to live and breath your values.

<p>Building a great engineering culture is not something that you easily do.
You cannot cheat.
It will not automatically happen by copying the values and organization structure from another company such as Spotify.
You need to really invest in creating a culture that works for your company.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can look at organizational structures, values and principles from other companies to get inspired.
Sit down with your people and decide together what is important for your company.

<p>Many attempts at achieving business agility are misguided and fake.
But I consider the glass half full, not half empty.</p>

Fake agile is a <strong>treatable</strong> disorder.</p>
