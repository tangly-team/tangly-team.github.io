<p>Recently a client told me that they were adopting the Spotify Model.
This statement sounded great for him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spotify has published some great articles and videos about how they have grown and transformed their organization to be agile.
Then it occurred to me that what my customer was saying was completely wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t think you can really understand what it is like to work at Spotify without actually living it.
You see, most of us are working from our own paradigm and belief system.
We have a hard time imagining how it really works at Spotify.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you review the below list, do a gut check.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Are you doing this today?</p>

<p>Would these approaches even fly at your company?</p>

<p>What would it take to implement them?</p>

<p>That may be the best test of whether you are anywhere near the <em>Spotify model</em>.</p>

<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Do not scale agile…descale your organization</dt>
<dd>
<p>Henrik starts with this quote which directly conflicts with the 5% of people who claim to be scaling agile using Spotify.
It isn’t about changing agile to fit your company, it is changing your organization to achieve business agility.<br/>
<em>Have you considered descaling your organization before scaling agile?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Your Company is <strong>not</strong> Spotify</dt>
<dd>
<p>Spotify was born agile in 2006, so it is not even 20 years old.
And Spotify is small at roughly 1,500 people.<br/>
<em>Is your company new, do you have thousands of people and a rich history of success doing things a certain way?</em> <em>Do you have layers and layers of rules and bureaucracy for the right way to do things, as well as plenty of checks and balances?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Spotify was on a Mission</dt>
<dd>
<p>The stated Spotify mission is to turn the music business upside down.<br/>
<em>Does your company have a compelling purpose that aligns and motivates people?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Squad is equivalent to Scrum Team</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like Scrum teams, squads are cross-functional and self-organizing.
They are responsible for end-to-end delivery of a complete project.<br/>
<em>Are your “squads” self-organizing?</em> <em>Are they capable of end to end delivery or do you have hand-offs to other teams or departments?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Squads are Autonomous</dt>
<dd>
<p>Autonomy is the key to the company.
It includes not just what to work on next or how to complete their work.
Autonomy helps to scale because they don’t need as much central function.
Autonomy is fun and motivating.<br/>
<em>Are the squads you created autonomous?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Motivation is Essential for Productivity</dt>
<dd>
<p>Kniberg talks about how important employee motivation is to resolving the inevitable environmental issues.
Motivation has a higher impact on productivity than any other factor.
Kniberg has a simple formula showing that Productivity = Effort X Competence X Environment X Motivation^2.<br/>
<em>Is your company focused on increasing the motivation of each employee?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Balance alignment and autonomy</dt>
<dd>
<p>Spotify strives to strike a balance between alignment (central direction) and autonomy (team self-organization).
Managers paint the big picture but don’t tell people how to solve it.
This is probably one of the biggest sticking points for most organizations – managers are directly involved in telling people how to solve problems.<br/>
<em>Who makes decisions in your organization?</em> <em>What is the balance of power between team members and managers?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Shape the Environment</dt>
<dd>
<p>Physical space supports informal collaboration and coordination.
At Spotify, Squads sit and work together.
Tribes sit near each other and there are plenty of spaces for informal meetings without having to schedule a conference room.<br/>
<em>Has your company made an effort to co-locate people working together on the same team or tribe?</em> <em>Does your physical space support informal meetings without going to the trouble to schedule a conference room?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">No Magic in the terms Squads and Tribes</dt>
<dd>
<p>Henrik said he was not sure why they used weird words like Squads and Tribes.
The label itself means nothing.
Each tribe is a cross-functional team that is vertically aligned for delivery.<br/>
<em>Did you change your existing team to a squad without changing anything else?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Guilds are cross-cutting areas of Expertise</dt>
<dd>
<p>Guilds are the equivalent of Communities of Practice.
They are not functional departments, they are volunteer-led communities based around a particular expertise.<br/>
<em>Are your guilds communities based on expertise, or are they organized around key managers or existing functional departments?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Emphasis on face 2 face communications</dt>
<dd>
<p>That is the purpose of the structure of Tribes, Squads, and Guilds.
They were formed based on the need to coordinate and collaborate.
Tribes and Squads were organized so that they can sit together.<br/>
<em>Does your organization put a priority on face to face communications?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Boring Releases</dt>
<dd>
<p>Long release cycles are scary and risky.
Frequent releases are less scary, less risky and easy.
They become routine and boring.<br/>
<em>How often are you releasing to Production?
Are your releases scary or are they boring?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Decoupled Releases and CI/CD Reduces Cycle Time</dt>
<dd>
<p>Spotify focused on changing the architecture to decouple dependencies and make releases easier.
Dependencies are reduced and teams can release to production independent of each other.
Spotify has also invested heavily in continuous delivery to automate getting code to production in minutes, not days or weeks.<br/>
<em>On average, how long does it take to get from a changed line of code to that code live in production?
Do you measure and track this?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Trust and the Self-Service Model</dt>
<dd>
<p>Spotify empowers and trusts people so that where possible, teams make decisions that involve risks.
Kniberg uses the example of the difference in control between a roundabout and a typical traffic light.
Where possible, Spotify trusts people and does not try to control them because they believe that most people are doing what is best for the organization.<br/>
<em>What is the level of trust you place on your employees and teams?</em> <em>Are they empowered with opportunities for self-service, or are there checks and balances and delays due to waiting for approvals that slow them down?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Transparency &amp; short feedback loops</dt>
<dd>
<p>Transparency is one of the pillars of Scrum and essential for all agility.
Transparency is also an enabler for self-organization.
Similarly, short feedback loops provide opportunities for inspection and adaptation.
Fast feedback ensures teams are building the most valuable features.<br/>
<em>How long are your sprints?</em> <em>What is the time between when a team builds something and when a real customer uses or provides feedback on that feature?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Managers are Servant Leaders</dt>
<dd>
<p>Spotify believes that managers are servant leaders, focused on serving the highest needs of the team.
They think it is better for managers to ask teams how then can help, rather than asking people what they are working on or when they will be done.<br/>
<em>What is the posture of your managers to your teams?
Do they serve the teams, or do they think that the teams serve them?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Lean Startup</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Spotify mantra seems to be <em>Think it, Build it, Tweak it, Ship it</em> based on Eric Ries and the Lean Startup approach.
Teams establish a hypothesis and then run experiments and A/B tests and measure the results.
They strive to get lots of feedback, tweak what they implement and maximize the value.<br/>
They know the difference between maximizing value and not just output (i.e. more user stories completed).
<em>Are you set up to run small experiments?</em> <em>Or are your products/projects the result of a long list of requirements that are all built before deploying to production in a big bang?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Spotify Hack Week</dt>
<dd>
<p>Twice a year Spotify hosts a hack week when they let everyone work for a week on whatever they want.
The approach unleashes creativity and improves cross-organizational collaboration They celebrate with a party on Friday.<br/>
<em>How comfortable would your company be with a one-week hackathon that allows people to do whatever they want?</em> <em>What controls do you think your leaders would demand for that week (e.g. assigned work, time reporting, must show results, etc).</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Experiment-friendly Culture</dt>
<dd>
<p>More data-driven decisions, not decisions made by the highest paid person.
Teams are encouraged to develop a hypothesis and run an experiment.
Teams establish “Keep List” which may include things like: Retros, daily stand-ups, Google Drives, GIT, and Guild UnConferences.
They also have a “Dump List”: Time Reports, Hand-offs, Separate Test Teams or Test Phases, Task Estimates, Useless Meeting.<br/>
<em>Do you allow teams the freedom to really change how they work?</em> <em>Which on the dump list above do you require your teams to do and why?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Healthy Cultures Heals Broken Process</dt>
<dd>
<p>Process breaks left and right but a healthy culture will lead to people fixing those problems.<br/>
<em>How heavy is your process?</em> <em>Are teams allowed to change process or is the process dictated by a central Agile CoE or standards group?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Balance between Chaos and Bureaucracy</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like the balance between autonomy and alignment, Spotify is striking a balance between chaos and bureaucracy.
Of the two, Kniberg believes it is easier to fix chaos than bureaucracy.
Similar to Alistair Cockburn’s “barely sufficient” process guidance, Spotify came up with the concept of “minimum viable bureaucracy” or MVB.
It is the smallest amount of bureaucracy that an organization can have without chaos.<br/>
<em>What is the level of bureaucracy in your organization?</em> <em>Do your managers actively work to reduce or eliminate overhead so that teams can focus on being productive?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Team Definition of Awesome</dt>
<dd>
<p>Spotify encourages teams to talk about and decide what would make them awesome.
After all, without a vision for awesomeness, you likely won’t get there.
Spotify teams use regular team health checks.
They track improvements over time.<br/>
<em>Do your teams have a definition of awesome?
Do you track team health and strive for continuous improvement?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Culture Beats Process</dt>
<dd>
<p>As we have outlined in this post, the obvious and observable processes you have are not nearly as important as the culture which may be nearly invisible.
Culture is the behavior that is rewarded or what succeeds.
Culture cannot be delegated by managers and leaders.
Leaders need to model the behavior they want to see in an organization.<br/>
<em>What are the behaviors that are rewarded in your organization?
What are the behaviors that are modeled?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Employee Satisfaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>Kniberg tells the story of an email from the head of people operations about the results of a recent employee satisfaction survey.
The head claimed that 91% of employees enjoyed working at Spotify, which he said was “of course not satisfactory”.<br/>
<em>Do your leaders ask if people enjoy working at your company?</em> <em>What % satisfaction do you think your leadership and HR department consider acceptable?</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Mistakes are OK</dt>
<dd>
<p>How mistakes are treated may be one of the best indicators of your culture.
Mistakes are expected when you are pushing for innovation.</p>
</dd>

<p><a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle Build Tool</a> is my preferred build tool for all Java applications I am developing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Google chose Gradle as the official build tool for Android.
Not only because build scripts are code, but because Gradle is modeled in a way that is extensible in the most fundamental ways.
Gradle’s model also allows it to be used for native development with C/C++ and can be expanded to cover any ecosystem.
For example, Gradle is designed with embedding in mind using its Tooling API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What are my preferred goodies with the major version 7?</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_java_module_native_support">Java Module Native Support</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java modules were introduced with Java 9 in September 2017.
Adoption was slow.
Developers needed time to understand the tremendous advantages of language and compiler support of modules.
Tooling was also a problem.
It was cumbersome and error-prone to create Java modules either using the command line and experimental plugins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle Build Tool</a> version 7 finally supports Java modules natively.
Just use the <em>java-library</em> plugin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The plugin will detect the presence of a <em>module-info.java</em> module declaration file and transparently switch to module compilation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_dependencies_semantic_declaration">Dependencies Semantic Declaration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Gradle team has decided to introduce semantic support for the declaration of dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All dependencies of a multi-module Java application are declared in a central file.
The <em>libs.versions.toml</em> file under the gradle subdirectory of the root build can contain all plugin and library dependencies.
The declarations can be used in all subprojects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Support is provided to group a set of related dependencies and use the alias in the various Gradle modules.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_intellij_support">IntelliJ Support</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jetbrains has improved support of Gradle in their new releases of IntelliJ.
The 2021 versions offer native support of Gradle.
Native support means IntelliJ finally uses Gradle for compilation and unit testing inside the IDE.
You just need to take care of one build configuration and no more need to delve in the mysteries of IntelliJ build process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only glitch is that IntelliJ has its own concept of modules and are not synchronized with the Gradle modules.
You have to be careful to align both structures to avoid surprises.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_jacoco_aggregated_test_coverage_reports">Jacoco Aggregated Test Coverage Reports</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pmi.org">Project Management Institute</a> has acquired the disciplined agile delivery method and heavily promotes the approach.
I personally prefer the <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> approach to scale agile product development.
Nevertheless, Scott Ambler is an experienced and talented developer.
Learning from his experiences and analyzing his approaches promotes the essence of <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a>.

<li>
<p><strong>Supports process tailoring</strong>.
I think that figures below make it very clear how people are enabled to make intelligent process decisions.
I think that this is a huge improvement over previous process frameworks, particularly Rational Unified Process <em>RUP</em>.
<em>RUP</em> provides great process advice regardless of what some agilists may claim but struggled to provide consumable process tailoring advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enables effective scaling</strong>.  <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> is our preferred scaling approach.
An important part of scaling agile is to tailor your strategy to reflect the realities of the scaling factors which you face.
For example, consider your approach to exploring the initial scope of your effort (the goal captured in Figure 2).
A large agile team or a geographically distributed team will make different tailoring decisions than a small co-located team.
A team in a regulatory environment will make different decisions, particularly around amount of detail, than teams in non-regulatory environments.
These are just three of several scaling factors (more on this in a future blog posting, although you may find my agility at scale blog to be of interest).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Makes your process options very clea</strong>.
Figure 4, in combination with the more detailed goals diagrams (such as in Figures 2 and 3) make it very clear what you need to consider when tailoring an agile solution delivery process to meet the unique needs of the situation faced by your team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Takes the guesswork out of extending agile methods</strong>.
Although it makes for wonderful marketing rhetoric, it’s disingenuous for people to claim that simple methods such as Scrum can be tailored to meet your actual needs.
Yes, we suppose this claim is true but how do you do so?
Shouldn’t you start with a full delivery lifecycle, not just a construction lifecycle?
Shouldn’t the toolkit cover a wider range of issues, such as leadership and requirements management as Scrum does, technical issues as XP does, modeling and documentation as Agile Modeling does, and many other issues?
In short, shouldn’t it be a hybrid?
Finally, shouldn’t you be given some context-sensitive advice for tailoring the details, as we do with the goal-driven approach described here?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Makes it clear what risks you’re taking on</strong>.
By making your process decision options clear, and by describing the trade-offs associated with those options, we make it very clear what risks you’re taking on.
Want to write a detailed requirement specification up front then the approach is going to make it very clear what risks you’ve just taken on by doing so.
It also makes clear when this decision is appropriate, so if you’re not in this situation then it is likely time to rethink your approach.
Although we cannot prevent challenges such as a Water-Scrum-Fall approach.
Such when a heavy approach is taken to <em>Inception</em> and <em>Transition</em> and an agile approach to Construction.
We still can certainly make it very clear what the impact is of the decisions that led you to that approach.
We have spoken with several people who have used the decision tables in it to argue against inappropriate process decisions on their projects.
In many situations the argument <em>that isn’t agile</em> falls on deaf ears.
Whereas <em>that will take longer and here’s why</em>, <em>that will be more expensive and here’s why</em> will be listened to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It hints at an agile maturity model</strong>.
We suggest that in the case of issues where the options are ordered there is a clearly an indication of agile maturity or sophistication.
Having said that I have no desire to wade into the agile maturity model morass, but I think it is an important observation nonetheless.</p>

<p>Non-experts often estimate that it is a lot of work, maybe even weeks or months of work to upgrade from one LTS version to the next LTS version of Java.

If you have the time available, I would recommend using the latest version of Java because you can use the new features and improvements.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Answers can often be found through Google or StackOverflow.
That way, it is easier to get the upgrades done instead of in one big bang.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, even after years of experience, I cannot estimate how long an upgrade will take without having in-depth information about the project.
A lot depends on how many dependencies your application has.
Often, upgrading your dependencies to the latest version resolves many of the issues that would occur during a Java upgrade.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do we move forward?
Now we start by compiling the source code on the new Java version, we run it.
If that succeeds, and we make the necessary fixes, we go to running the unit tests.
If we fix that as well, we can package the application, and in the end, we can run the application.
Based on the nice ingredients, we should get a nice result.</p>

<h4 id="_pattern_matching_for_switch">Pattern Matching for Switch</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A preview of pattern matching for switch extends the language of patterns in Java.
It allows switch expressions and statements to be tested against a number of patterns, each with a specific action.
This enables complex data-oriented queries to be expressed concisely and safely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among the goals of this feature include expanding the expressiveness and application of switch expressions and statements by enabling patterns to appear for labels, relaxing the historical null-hostility of switch when desired, and introducing two kinds of patterns: guarded patterns, which allow pattern matching logic to be refined with arbitrary Boolean expressions, and parenthesized patterns, which resolve some parsing ambiguities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In JDK 16 <a href="#jdk-16">[2]</a>, the <em>instanceof</em> operator was extended to take a type pattern and perform pattern matching.
The modest extension proposed allows the familiar instanceof-and-cast idiom to be simplified.
The implementation of the <em>boolean equals(Object o)</em> method is reduced to one expression without any conditional statement.
<em>Try the new implementation in your code</em>.</p>

<p>The line between software development and software architecture is a tricky one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some people will tell you that it does not exist and that architecture is simply an extension of the design process undertaken by developers.
Others will make out it is a massive gaping chasm that can only be crossed by lofty developers.
They believe you must always abstract your abstractions and not get bogged down by those pesky implementation details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As always, there is a pragmatic balance somewhere in the middle, but it does raise the interesting question of how you move from one to the other.</p>

<h3 id="_key_takeaways">Key Takeaways</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Understanding the basics of software architecture is more important than ever before, given the distributed nature of the software systems we are now building, and the distributed nature of the teams building them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sweet spot of up front design, between too much and none at all, should focus on understanding the significant decisions and trade-offs that influence the shape of a software system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good architects are active members of the development team, from collaborating on code to coaching and providing technical leadership to the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicating about software architecture is challenging.
The <a href="https://c4model.com/">C4</a> model can help structure the communication, starting with a context diagram, and working down to more technical aspects of the
system.</p>

<li>
<p>Contrary to some popular assumptions, putting effort towards good architecture actually enables agility.</p>

<li>
<p>This should include creating a sprint goal, selecting product backlog items (PBIs) with a value orientation in mind and decomposing PBIs into smaller work items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This emphasizes the collaboration between the members of the Scrum team, especially product owner and developers, for understanding the items and turning them into a valuable stepping stone toward the product goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methods to organize the daily Scrum could be: original three questions, walk the wall, collaborative daily Scrum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Description, order, size, domain-specific attributes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This could include asking for clarification, adding acceptance criteria, sizing or estimating items, breaking them down into smaller items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For software, a definition of done could state that each increment fulfills the acceptance criteria, contains no blocking defects, is integrated into the system, is properly tracked in a version control system, and is documented according to the necessary documentation guidelines.
There could be other elements, too.
The point of this LO is to raise the awareness of done, especially <em>done for whom?</em>.</p>

<p><em>Collaboration &amp; Team Dynamics</em></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">

<li>
<p>This could include stable membership, reaching a shared goal by working together, self-management.</p>

<p><em>Refactoring</em></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Refactoring is the practice of improving a system without changing its observable behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refactoring fosters automated testing, improves readability and maintainability; it can support improving system performance, counter technical debt, and improve extensibility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Test Driven Development (TDD)</em></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Test first focuses on the behavior of the system.
The system design emerges dynamically through the adjustment to additional tests.
Benefits include simplicity, avoidance of bloating, defect reduction, built-in regression checks with automated tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differences include frequency, inclusion in the development process, being tied to specification versus being tied to code, amount of automation, responsibility, timing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Point out that it is important to have the simplest possible solution that passes the test in the first place to ensure the test is working, and refactor it to a sensible design that can be verified immediately, refer to the Broken Window metaphor, foster collective stewardship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testers are Scrum team members, aka developers, include testing in the sizing discussion, collaborate on PBI refinement and acceptance criteria definition, pair up doing TDD
to embed good tests from the beginning, include considerations of load, exploratory, and other testing approaches, contribute to definition of done.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Integrating Continuously</em></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>CI is the practice of reducing the feedback time between code creation and integration.
It can be supported using technical means.
CI changes habits and behaviors, creates awareness about shared responsibility.
It is the base for frequent deliveries, reduces defects, reduces risk from late discovery of integration issues.</p>
<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i">
<li>
<p>Example 1: The increment is necessarily integrated.
Using CI is highly recommendable for getting to at least one increment per sprint or more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example 2: The daily Scrum can provide better transparency about the progress if there is a better measure for progress.
CI helps to get this transparency about what is working and what isn’t.
Without CI, the Scrum team might probably not know the actual status of the system for days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example 3: In the sprint review, only done PBIs are inspected.
CI improves the probability of having done PBIs at the end of the <a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#the-sprint">sprint</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automation tools reduce manual repetition, single repository acts as document of record, configuration as code for repeatable error-free process and support continuous delivery</p>

<p>The arc42 approach is heavily influenced by their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process">RUP</a> roots.
This heritage is one major reason why this approach is not extensively taught in the course.</p>

<p>Bachelor students have attended formal training in UML and scientific diagramming notations such as <a href="https://c4model.com/">C4</a> or

<p>The ISAQB foundation is kind of a laggard.
Most of their trainings are for classical software and enterprise architecture.
They have finally understood lately that agile is won the war how to develop digital products.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>THe ISAQB programs teach skills in three areas: technological competence, methodical competence, and communicative competence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key points are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The concept and meaning of software architecture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tasks and responsibility for you as a software architect</p>

<li>
<p>Your role as a software architect in projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State-of-the-art methods and techniques for the development of software architectures</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The taught skills are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>How can you coordinate essential software architecture decisions with other project participants from the fields of requirements management, project management, testing and development?</p>
</li>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this module, the participants learn how to design, develop and further develop software systems and architectures in accordance with agile principles.
On the one hand, the module covers the application of agile principles and concepts to architecture work.
On the other hand, expedient anchoring of architecture practices in an agile approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The development of architectures in projects with self-sufficient teams or shared responsibilities demands new skills and capabilities on the part of developers and architects.
These in turn cover technical as well as methodical and communicative aspects, which are addressed here all theoretically and in practical exercises.</p>

<p>Care was taken that all the above aspects are handled over the SWAT course.
The main difference is the SWAT course has a more technical approach to agile architecture.
Communication, team findings techniques and documentation are discussed in <a href="#chapter-4">Agile Approaches</a>, <a href="#chapter-10">Architecture Documentation</a> and <a href="#chapter-14">Excellence for Architects</a>.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a> from previous lectures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They can seldom apply these principles in their own code or semester projects.
Understanding why certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">anti-patterns</a> are often wrong is seldom observable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can only become a professional software architect if you are proficient in a technology stack.
You shall be a craftsman about how to write industrial grade source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You know how to test it, deploy it, run it and maintain it.
You shall have knowledge of the idioms of your programming language and software design patterns at the component level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The students are motivated and eager to learn.
It takes time to establish the capabilities of a professional programmer and component designer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This time is missing in our SWAT lecture for the discussion of product software architecture themes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are now defining an overall path for all students to achieve craftsmanship over their bachelor curriculum.
Students must write professional source code, master design at the component level, and understand agile techniques.
Approaches such as clean code, test-driven development, refactoring and infrastructure as code shall be studied material.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_design_and_architecture">Design and Architecture</h4>

<p>Design concepts must be refined.
The students understand concepts such as patterns, micro-architecture, layered architecture.
They seldom formulate the technical and financial tradeoffs associated with a specific concept application

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Almost no student has experience with open source libraries.
They use them on a daily basis and never looked at the source code, provided an improvement, or read the documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are trying to formulate an approach to improve achieved goals.
We shall either build these concepts into project management lectures or in the semester theses.</p>

<p>However, in recent Hugo versions, external helpers are an official feature.
It calls appropriate external programs to certain type of files.
Fortunately, Asciidoc based files are automatically compiled with <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a>, so we do not need to do anything.
Just have it installed and you are ready to go.</p>

<p>The Hugo theme <a href="https://www.docsy.dev/">Docsy</a> is ideal to create a good-looking software documentation site.
This theme is currently the best match I found to combine product documentation with blogging.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer <em>siloed</em>.
Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle.
The work is from development through test, deployment to operations.
The range of skills is not limited to a single function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations.
When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as <em>DevSecOps</em>.</p>

<p>These teams practice automating processes that historically have been manual and slow.
They use a technology stack and tooling, which helps them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably.
These tools also help engineers independently carry out tasks that normally would have required help from other teams.

<h3 id="_benefits">Benefits</h3>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Speed</dt>
<dd>
<p>Move at high velocity, so you can innovate for customers faster, adapt to changing markets better, and grow more efficient at driving business results.
The DevOps model enables your developers and operations teams to achieve these results.
For example, microservices and continuous delivery let teams take ownership of services and then release updates to them quicker.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Rapid Delivery</dt>
<dd>
<p>Increase the frequency and pace of releases, so you can innovate and improve your product faster.
The quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the faster you can respond to your customers’ needs and build a competitive advantage.
Continuous integration and continuous delivery are practices that automate the software release process, from build to deploy.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Reliability</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes, so you can reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience.
Use practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery to test that each change is functional and safe.
Monitoring and logging practices help you stay informed of performance in real-time.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Scale</dt>
<dd>
<p>Operate and manage your infrastructure and development processes at scale.
Automation and consistency help you manage complex or changing systems efficiently and with reduced risk.
For example, infrastructure as code helps you manage your development, testing and production environments in a repeatable and more efficient manner.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Improved Collaboration</dt>
<dd>
<p>Build more effective teams under a DevOps cultural model, which emphasizes values such as ownership and accountability.
Developers and operations teams collaborate closely, share many responsibilities, and combine their workflows.
This reduces handover inefficiencies and diminishes cycle-time.
It reduces, for example, handover periods between developers and operations, writing code that takes into account the environment in which it is run.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Security</dt>
<dd>
<p>Move quickly while retaining control and preserving compliance.
You can adopt a DevOps model without sacrificing security by using automated compliance policies.
For example, using infrastructure as code and policy as code, you can define and then track compliance at scale.</p>
</dd>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_devops_adoption">DevOps Adoption</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transitioning to DevOps requires a change in culture and mindset.
At its simplest, DevOps is about removing the barriers between two traditionally siloed teams, development and operations.
In some organizations, there may not even be separate development and operations teams; engineers may do both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With DevOps, the two teams work together to optimize both the productivity of developers and the reliability of operations.
They strive to communicate frequently, increase efficiencies, and improve the quality of services they provide to customers.
They take full ownership for their services, often beyond where their stated roles or titles have traditionally been scoped.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Quality assurance and security teams may also become tightly integrated with these teams.
Organizations using a DevOps model have teams that view the entire development and infrastructure lifecycle as part of their responsibilities.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_devops_practices">DevOps Practices</h3>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous Integration</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Continuous integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository.
Automated builds and tests are run upon changes in the repository.
The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate software updates.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">Continuous Delivery</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production.
It expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment or a production environment after the build stage.
When continuous delivery is implemented properly, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Modular Systems and Microservices</dt>
<dd>
<p>The microservice’s architecture is a design approach to build a single application as a set of small services.
Each service runs in its own process and communicates with other services through a well-defined interface using a lightweight mechanism.
Microservices are built around business capabilities; each service is scoped to a single purpose.
You can use different frameworks or programming languages to write microservices and deploy them independently, as a single service, or as a group of services.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">Infrastructure as Code</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Infrastructure as code is a practice in which infrastructure is provisioned and managed to use code and software development techniques.
Examples are version control and continuous integration.
The cloud’s API-driven model enables developers and system administrators to interact with infrastructure programmatically.
They do need to interact manually set up and configure resources.
Engineers can interface with infrastructure using code-based tools and treat infrastructure in a manner similar to how they treat application code.
Because they are defined by code, infrastructure and servers can quickly be deployed using standardized patterns, updated with the latest patches and versions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Monitoring and Logging</dt>
<dd>
<p>Organizations monitor metrics and logs to see how application and infrastructure performance impacts the experience of their product’s end user.
By capturing, categorizing, and then analyzing data and logs generated by applications and infrastructure, organizations understand how changes or updates impact users, shedding insights into the root causes of problems or unexpected changes.
Active monitoring becomes increasingly important as services must be available 24/7 and as application and infrastructure update frequency increases.
Creating alerts or performing real-time analysis of these data also helps organizations more proactively monitor their services.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Communication and Collaboration</dt>
<dd>
<p>Increased communication and collaboration in an organization is one of the key cultural aspects of DevOps.
The use of DevOps tooling and automation of the software delivery process establishes collaboration by physically bringing together the workflows and responsibilities of development and operations.
Building on top of that, these teams set strong cultural norms around information sharing and facilitating communication through the use of chat applications, issue or project tracking systems, and wikis.
This helps speed up communication across developers, operations, and even other teams like marketing or sales, allowing all parts of the organization to align more closely on goals and projects.</p>
</dd>

<h3 id="_devops_tools">DevOps Tools</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A DevOps toolchain is a set or combination of tools that aid in the delivery, development, and management of software applications throughout the system development life cycle, as coordinated by an organisation that uses DevOps practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<h3 id="_what_is_java_devops">What is Java DevOps?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java DevOps is simply applying DevOps practices and philosophies to Java app development.
That means that compartmentalized teams are no longer needed when creating Java applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should understand these principles:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous integration</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This practice requires developers to periodically merge the code that they have written into a central repository.
After the merge, tests and automated builds are executed.
This allows a team to find issues and quickly quash out bugs, improve the application’s quality and then cut the time needed to validate your apps.
Often the step of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">Continuous Delivery</a> is added to the pipeline.<br/>
<em>Use a platform such as gitLab, gitHub, BitBucket, or Azure DevOps.
Use Gradle as your build tool.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment">Continuous delivery</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This practice requires your team to release into production all code changes after it is written and then automatically built, and tested.
If continuous integration puts your code changes onto a testing environment, continuous delivery puts it into a production environment.
What does this mean?
You will always have a production-ready Java application!<br/>
<em>Use Gradle to create your application.
Use Docker, Ansible to deploy.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">Microservices</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>DevOps make use of microservices.
Instead of having one big monolithic Java application, your application is made up of smaller and independent applications.<br/>
<em>Use domain driven design DDD as your architecture method.
Prefer standalone applications embedding your application server.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">Infrastructure as a code</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This practice means that infrastructure is allocated and then managed by using code and development techniques.
Cloud services can help your development and operations teams interact with infrastructure at a scale they are comfortable with.
With infrastructure as a code, servers and infrastructure are deployed fast, automatically patched and can easily be duplicated.<br/>
<em>Use Docker and Ansible to automate your deployment.</em></p>

<h3 id="_lessons_learnt">Lessons Learnt</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The motivations for what has become modern <em>DevOps</em> and several standard DevOps practices, such as automated build and test, continuous integration, and continuous delivery originated in the Agile world, which dates to the 1990s.
Agile development teams using methods such as <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> could not <em>satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software</em> unless they subsumed the operation responsibilities associated with their applications, many of which they automated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> emerged as the dominant Agile framework in the early 2000s, and it omitted the engineering practices that were part of many Agile teams, the movement to automate operations functions splintered from Agile and expanded into what has become modern DevOps <a href="#accelerate">[1]</a>.
Today, DevOps focuses on the deployment of developed software, whether it is developed via Agile or other methodologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To practice DevOps effectively, software applications have to meet a set of architecturally significant requirements such as: deployability, modifiability, testability, and monitorability.
You must continuously monitor your infrastructure, network and application.</p>

<p>You need a cultural change to implement successfully DevOps workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bigger companies often have trouble with the changes.
Command and control cultures always fail.
It boils down if your culture trusts your collaborators - often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_Theory_Y">Theory X and Theory Y</a> beliefs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interestingly, the DevOps transformation is similar to an agile transformation.
The approaches, recipes and failures are similar.</p>

<p>Smaller organizations are often more affine with trust.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although it is possible to practice DevOps with any architectural style, the microservices architectural style is becoming the standard for building continuously deployed systems.
Small size service allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring <a href="#continuous-delivery">[4]</a>  hence reducing the need for a big upfront design, allows for releasing the software early[citation needed] and continuously.</p>

<p>Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing.</p>

<p>You can use various indicators to detect the self-management requirement at the Scrum team level is no more than lip service:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You assign specific tasks directly to Developers, thus bypassing the Product Owner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, you remove a Developer from the Scrum team (temporarily) to work on such a task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers are assigned to support other organization members while ignoring their commitment to achieving the Sprint Goal.
Examples are supporting sales in a pitch, or being an expert in management meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scrum is rolled back in a moment of crisis to a traditional form of command &amp; control, exercised, for example, by dispatching jobs directly to individual Developers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ignoring self-management does not only violate Scrum’s first principles.
It also indicates that a manager cannot let go of command and control practices.
They continue to micromanage subordinates, although a Scrum team could accomplish the task themselves.
This behavior demonstrates a level of ignorance that may require support from a higher management level to address.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Architecture principles hold true in agile environments.
The major difference between older traditional approaches and modern agile ones is the way of performing enterprise architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last years have shown a promising evolution of plan-based, centralist enterprise architecture approaches to more agile, decentralized, meritocracy driven processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These new approaches are way more compatible with modern and agile software product development framework such as <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a>, <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a>, and <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Traditional processes use dedicated persons or departments to define architecture principles in a top-down approach.
Thick standards such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Architecture_Body_of_Knowledge">Enterprise Architecture Body of Knowledge</a> codifies wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Guide to the Enterprise Architecture Body of Knowledge (EABOK) organizes and characterizes the knowledge content of the Enterprise Architecture (EA) discipline.
This organization and characterization promotes a consistent view of EA, establishes the scope and bounds of the EA discipline, and places the discipline in the context of related disciplines.
The EABOK subdivides EA into knowledge areas and topics within each area, presents an overview of the topic, and provides the reader references for further information.
The EABOK is a guide to EA, not the body of knowledge itself.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The enterprise architects community has realized over the years that the centralist approach is too slow and cumbersome for the digital age.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group">Open Group</a> promotes the official enterprise architecture method
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework">TOGAF</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Open Group published a series of white papers <a href="#agile-architecture">[1]</a>, <a href="#open-agile-architecture">[2]</a> to bridge the gap between classical enterprise architecture and agile digital product development.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_architecture">Enterprise Architecture</a> <em>EA</em> , when performed in an agile manner, is an important enabler of agile software delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is true for several reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Common architecture enables agile teams to focus on value creation</dt>
<dd>
<p>A common enterprise architecture enables reuse across delivery teams.
When agile teams have high-quality assets – such as micro-services, legacy data sources, and frameworks – they are able to focus on creating new value.
They should not waste money on reinventing new versions of existing infrastructure.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Common technical guidance enables greater consistency</dt>
<dd>
<p>When team follow effective, common conventions it results in greater quality.
This makes it easier to learn about assets that are new to them, in particular existing source code, and to evolve those assets as needed.
Greater consistency also makes it easier for people to move between teams.
It will be easier for them to come up to speed on what the new team is doing and to share their skills with those team members.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Agile architectures enable disaggregation</dt>
<dd>
<p>When your solutions are built from loosely coupled, highly cohesive components it is easier to spread development work across smaller teams.
This reduces overall risk and organizational complexity, which in turn reduces time-to-delivery.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Common infrastructure enables continuous delivery</dt>
<dd>
<p>A common technical infrastructure empowers delivery teams to deploy into it.
The easier it is to deploy, the more often it makes sense to deploy.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Enterprise architecture scales agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>An agile approach to enterprise architecture enables organizations to scale agile strategies “horizontally” across their entire IT department.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_ea_process">The EA Process</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some methods will choose to prescribe a single approach.
Such as capturing architectural requirements in the form of epics or pre-building <em>architectural runways</em>.
The agile toolkit promotes an adaptive, context-sensitive strategy.
A goal-driven approach that indicates the process decision points you need to consider.
Have a range of techniques or strategies for you to address each decision point, and the advantages and disadvantages of each technique.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following diagram overviews the potential activities associated with <em>Agile Enterprise Architecture</em>.
image::2021-07-02-entreprise-architecture-process.png[width=800,height=800,role=center]
The process decision points that you need to consider for enterprise architecture are:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Support stakeholders</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enterprise architects will work with business and IT stakeholders on a regular basis to understand their needs and to help them develop a vision for the organization.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Support delivery teams</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enterprise architects will work with IT delivery teams, and ideally be active members of IT delivery teams, on a regular basis.
They may guide the teams in the business and technical roadmaps, help them to identify potentially reusable assets, to identify technical debt.
They should transfer their skills and knowledge to team members.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Negotiate technical dependencies</dt>
<dd>
<p>Like it or not, there are dependencies between the solutions that we create.
For example, if your system invokes a web service, or calls an API, provided by another system then you have a dependency on that system.
Enterprise architects will often find that they need to negotiate these dependencies with other teams, either at a high-level in their role of Enterprise Architect or sometimes at a detailed level in their role of Architecture Owner on a delivery team.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Explore architectural views</dt>
<dd>
<p>Organizations are complex and as a result they must be understood from a variety of view points.
It’s not just a matter of writing “architectural epics” on a collection of index cards.
The enterprise architecture team may choose to adopt, and likely tailor, an existing enterprise architecture framework.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Tailor the chosen architecture framework</dt>
<dd>
<p>These frameworks typically suggest a multi-view collection of artifacts to create and techniques for doing so.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Evolve enterprise architecture</dt>
<dd>
<p>Enterprise architects will collaborate with one another, and with their stakeholders, in a variety of ways.
They may choose to hold architecture envisioning/modeling sessions or regular meetings where they share learnings with one another.
They will often work together, or with IT delivery teams, to investigate new technologies or identify candidate architecture strategies.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Evolve roadmap(s)</dt>
<dd>
<p>An important output of your enterprise architecture effort will be one or more roadmaps.
They describe your technology strategies and your architectural strategies.
The roadmaps are updated in a rolling wave approach where the roadmap(s) are updated regularly.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Capture enterprise architecture</dt>
<dd>
<p>There are two broad categories for how enterprise architects can capture their work: as documents or as working/executable examples.
High-level models work well for the documentation.
Executable artifacts, such as executable reference architectures or architectural runways, are usually preferred over documentation by delivery teams.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Govern architecture</dt>
<dd>
<p>Architectural activities within your organization should be governed in a lightweight, collaborative manner.
This is an important activity for enterprise architects as well as for your IT governance team.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_team_workflow">Team Workflow</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The workflow within an agile enterprise architecture team is depicted in the following diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock center">
<div class="content">
<img src="../pics/2021-07-02-team-workflow.jpg" alt="2021 07 02 team workflow" width="800" height="400"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are four major activities:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Envision initial architecture</dt>
<dd>
<p>The enterprise architects will spend several days developing initial, high-level models of the enterprise architecture.
This will be a face-to-face, initial architecture envisioning session where the scope is the entire organization, not just a single IT solution.
Ideally this is done in an agile modelling room to streamline the communication and collaborative modelling efforts.
Such a room is large with lots of whiteboard space, enabling the team to work on several models in parallel (each of which has its own section of wall space).
The primary purpose of this session is for the EA team to develop a common understanding, at least a high level, of the current state of the enterprise architecture and a vision for how the team would like to see it evolve.
Secondary outcomes include creating some initial artifacts.
The enterprise architects will evolve these artifacts over time, meeting one another for the first time, and building bonds between the team members.
Potential challenges to this activity include getting an agile modeling room, and the logistics of getting the right people together at the same time.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Collaborate with business stakeholders</dt>
<dd>
<p>On a regular basis enterprise architects work with business stakeholders to understand their needs.
They work with them to envision the future, and help educate them on the possibilities and constraints of technology.
This collaboration may be in the form of working sessions, presentations, or one-on-one conversations.
These sessions occur as needed and at times it can be difficult to gain access to stakeholders as they are often very busy people.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Collaborate with IT stakeholders</dt>
<dd>
<p>Disciplined agile EAs will spend the majority of their time, 80 to 90% of it typically, working as members of IT delivery teams.
By doing this they bring their knowledge, vision, and skills to the team in a pragmatic, hands-on manner.
The teams will often take on the role of <em>architecture owners</em>.
Enterprise architects will also work with other IT stakeholders, including operations engineers, support staff, the data management team.
They need to understand their needs.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Evolve architecture assets</dt>
<dd>
<p>The enterprise architecture team, or at least the portion of the team who is currently available, will meet on a regular basis.
They evolve the enterprise architecture assets based on their learnings.
A common pattern we have seen it for the team to meet every Friday afternoon for two hours.
They discuss what they’ve learned that week from working on delivery teams and working with their various stakeholders.
The result of the meeting is often that the enterprise architects may take on action items to update existing artifacts.
These artifacts may include EA models, reference architectures, development guidelines, white papers.
When a new major topic arises, such as the potential adoption of a new platform or a merger with another organization, they schedule agile modelling sessions.
They explore the newly discovered topics during these sessions.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Various organizations are trying to redefine enteprise architecture in the context of agile approaches.
Such an example would be the <em>Agile Enterprise Architecture Framework</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often you see the tension between more agility and the drag of traditional complex enterprise architecture frameworks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The regular enterprise architecture frameworks are too complicated to be applied in nimble product development.
The approach is cumbersome and slow.
The processes are based on the assumption documents are written and later a group of experts review them.
Agile approaches are too nimble and fast to mesh with such workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The techniques used in these frameworks are powerful ones.
Software designers should master and use them accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I strongly prefer the architecture work techniques described in <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a>.
The <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> framework uses good practices to improve architecture and design.
Their approach is highly compatible with agile practices and speed of development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I do not use the bloated TOGAF architecture standard.
I also avoid bloated agile methodologies such as <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I recommend using all these proven architecture techniques and tools.
Apply them on your software product development using agile approaches like <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> and <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a>.</p>

<h3 id="_product_owner_role">Product Owner Role</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here the official definition of the product owner role taken from the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/">Scrum Guide</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>Product Owner</strong> is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.
How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-owner">Product Owner</a> is also accountable for effective <strong>Product Backlog</strong> management, which includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developing and explicitly communicating the <strong>Product Goal</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating and clearly communicating <strong>Product Backlog</strong> items;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ordering <strong>Product Backlog Items</strong>; and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that the <strong>Product Backlog</strong> is transparent, visible and understood.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others.
Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions.
These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the <strong>Product Backlog</strong>, and through the inspectable <strong>Increment</strong> at the <strong>Sprint Review</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.
The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the <strong>Product Backlog</strong>.
Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.</p>

<p>Advanced course for Product Owners who already have one year of experience on a Scrum team.<br/>
<em>It is at least two days training.
You should read the recommended books to have a greater probability to pass the examination on the first try.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Certified Scrum Professional Product Owner</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pinnacle course for experts wishing to master the Product Owner track.<br/>
<em>The third level requires more training, experience, and reading books.
You often must participate to workshops before being allowed to graduate.

</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beware if you select the <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/">Scrum Alliance</a>, you must renew your certification every two years.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agile approaches advocate dynamic planning and adaptation to new inputs and priority changes.
The <a href="http://bbrt.org/">Beyond Budgeting Round Table</a> movement promotes rolling planning, budgeting and reporting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>beyond budgeting</em> techniques recommend the complete abolition of traditional budgeting processes.
They require the implementation of new techniques that will replace them.
The BB framework does not specify the exact techniques that are applicable to all companies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, there are some techniques that have proven to be effective in real cases in the past.
These techniques include the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rolling forecasts are created monthly or quarterly rather than on an annual interval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Company’s targets are based on key performance indicators <em>KPI</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The performance of the company’s managers is evaluated based on external benchmarks rather than their past performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operational managers are empowered to react to the changes in the business environment and can dynamically coordinate their actions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What are the consequences of rolling approaches to any CRM or ERP system?</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_accounting">Accounting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rolling accounting is quite easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You shall display only transactions bocked during the selected time interval.
You shall be able to generate the balance sheet for the date defining the start of the time interval.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The data are usable only if your accounting department does not tune the accounts at the end of the quarter or at the end of the year.
For example, Swiss companies shall separate the rolling accounting from their legal accounting used for VAT or earnings tax purposes.
A better approach is to define rules avoiding most of the tuning actions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_customers_activities_and_offers">Customers, Activities and Offers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No special effort is necessary.
Customer relationship activities just need to be timely registered.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_contracts_and_projects">Contracts and Projects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only the contracts and projects active in the selected time interval shall be displayed.
Efforts booked during the time interval are relevant for the analytics.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_invoices">Invoices</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The invoices sent to the customers or the effectively paid invoices during the selected item interval shall be considered and displayed.
These invoices are relevant for the computation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow">cash flow</a> and the financial success of the associated projects
and contracts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_implementation">Implementation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tangly ERP was extended to support rolling analytics based on a user-defined time interval.
The system shall have all raw data available for the chosen time interval.
The approach is similar to an event store.
Designs based on a yearly reporting structure make the concept of rolling time periods almost impossible to realize.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system supports the definition of a time interval to display only currently relevant entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The analytics time interval is independent of the system overall interval.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lessons_learnt">Lessons Learnt</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture">Event sourcing</a> concepts are very powerful to implement an ERP providing time-interval based visualization and analysis.
The concept works well with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">Domain Driven Design</a> concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The responsiveness of the application is impressive for data volume compatible with small and medium enterprises.
We do not have empirical data for international companies.
The approach works well if all data are based on true and fair booking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Legal aspects in countries like Switzerland often imply that accounting reflects tax view instead of a true and fair view of the finances.
Such systems are not compatible with the beyond budget concepts and will display skewed information.
The whole financial system must be true and fair to enable rolling planning and reporting.</p>

<p>The agile approach continues to spread rapidly around the world: 89.8% of all teams have already adopted or are in the process of adopting agile methodology, a considerable number.
On the other hand, organizations are still struggling to build greater company-wide agility.
Only a few have already adopted agility on a portfolio level (15.3%) or strategic level (8.2%).
The good news is that many companies have started transformation initiatives or are planning to do so in the near future.</p>

<p>The major finding of the agile community during 2020 and 2021 is co-location is not mandatory for a successful agile approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remote working and distributed teams can work very successfully on a product.
You need high-quality tools such as videoconferencing, chat, collaborative tools and pair working approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The huge gain of 2020 and 2021 was the tremendous improvements of these tools due to the Corona lockdown.
Companies still need to invest in high-quality headsets, cameras and 4K displays for their collaborators.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not be penny wise and pound foolish.
Invest in professional hardware and buy the adequate number of licenses.
I always wonder why companies implement communication infrastructure with the free version of Slack or GitHub.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>During an agile, the organization needs to be changed.
You are involved and probably have no ‘official’ authority to affect the needed changes.
This is a good thing!
It requires you to convince people to change because they believe it is the Right Thing to do.
But influencing change in organizations is far from trivial.
Frequently, no matter how hard you have tried, it changes in the opposite direction.
The question then becomes, how do you survive?
Staying alive and sane in organizations requires:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Patience and low expectations</dt>

<p>Most organizations change slowly.
You should better set your expectations low (not your goal!), and remind yourself that you will be working on this for years.
Do celebrate small changes.</p>

<p>Agile fluency model is a powerful abstraction to better understand your agile transition.
It does not matter which flavor of agile you are deploying in your organization; the agile fluency model can be applied in all cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The agile fluency model has a powerful message about agile and technical excellence.
The second zone of the model is all about software craftsmanship and <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One key lesson of the fluency model is it takes time until you are professional at your chosen level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Time measured in years not in days.
Your organization needs years to transition to more agile ways of working.
Do not rush it.</p>

<h3 id="_zones">Zones</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The model defines four zones in which your company could thrive.
You are free to choose the zone best suited for your organization.
Remember the zones are additive.

<dt class="hdlist1">When Introducing Agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>One of the biggest factors affecting team fluency is an organizational support.
To continue the bus metaphor, the team has to ride the bus to their fluency zone.
No one can do it for them.
The organization has to buy the bus tickets.
An organization that expects fluency without providing appropriate support is bound to be disappointed.
Even worse, insufficient support can cause turnover and create a cynical corporate culture that hinders improvements.
Before embarking on your fluency journey, be sure your organization is prepared to offer the support the journey needs.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">When Sustaining Agile</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is rare for stable teams to lose fluency on their own.
In our experience, external disruptions cause fluency loss.
The most common cause of fluency loss is when new management decides that agile approaches do not fit their vision.
Without organizational support and the ability to continue practicing what they have learned, team fluency erodes quickly.
This is often accompanied by loss of expertise as dissatisfied team members seek new positions.
Turnover is a related cause of fluency loss.
A team that gains or loses too many members may have trouble sustaining what it is learned.
This is a particular problem for organizations that assemble new teams for every project.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Agile Fluency and Scrum</dt>
<dd>
<p>Agile and Scrum requires long-living and stable teams.
A team should work over years on one product development and improvements.
Agile at organizational level can only work if the upper and middle management transitioned to agile thinking and handling.
The <a href="https://less.works/">LeSS</a> community is vocal how destructive wrong management decision can be.
Agile development is a team sport, so fluency is a trait of the team, not individual team members.
Fluency is more a matter of habits than skills.
Discipline is king.</p>

<p>As a modern leader, you are aware of the importance of transforming your organization to become more agile.
Indeed, you have successfully implemented first steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Trouble is brewing.
Things are not moving forward as quickly as they should, especially in the current challenging situation.
The leadership behaviour of your colleagues is only changing slowly.
Your key developers are grumbling you are faking it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many companies around the world discover their agile transformation is stalling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://swissq.it/en/">SwissQ</a> report provides empirical data where Swiss companies stand in 2020.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_where_we_stand">Where We Stand</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The agile approach continues to spread rapidly around the world.
A stunning <strong>89.8%</strong> of all teams have already adopted or are in the process of adopting an agile methodology.
It is an impressive and considerable number.
It also shows when you look at the number of people who have a Scrum Master certification.
Around a million of them are Certified Scrum Master.
Quite a smaller number of people are Certified Product Owners.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, organizations are still struggling to build greater company-wide agility.
Only a few have already adopted agility on their product portfolio (15.3%) or on the strategic level (8.2%).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The good news is that many companies have started whole transformation initiatives or are planning to do so in the near future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating products with agile approaches is now mainstream.
Only laggards are clutching on obsolete methods.
Competitive advantage is now to implement an agile product value stream through the whole organization.
Fast delivery to customers and pivot to disruptive changes are the new key for extraordinary growth and success.
The raise of digital and Internet affine banking solutions is such a transformative example.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_waterfall_vs_agile">Waterfall vs Agile</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The collected data clearly show agile approaches are tremendously more successful by more than 10%.
The agile approach seems to eliminate catastrophic development failures.
It means an agile team has 25% higher relative probability to be victorious than classical teams (<em>50.5% versus 39.5%</em>).</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_transformation_drivers">Transformation Drivers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IT department is still the main driver for agile transformation.
Going fully agile is challenging and sticking with waterfall is no more an option.
Leaving many companies stuck in a hybrid approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Swiss companies are often embracing Hermes
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> or <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFe</a>.
Both approaches are quite a poor choice to achieve a successful agile transformation.
Read the technology radar of <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com">Thoughworks</a> for a detailed discussion why SAFe is a poor choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Satisfaction with the agile way of working is high; satisfaction with the transformation process is low.
The focus is still processes over people.
The JIRA tool is omnipresent and workflows are documented in acribic details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This has left many, about 40% to be exact, stuck in a hybrid approach, i.e., a combination of waterfall and agile.
This is not necessarily a catastrophic thing if you manage to get the best of both worlds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kanban offers an easy start with agile and unlike Scrum is applicable to any process.
As our numbers show, it is becoming more and more popular.
Remember, it is not Kanban if it doesn’t have WIP limits.</p>

<p>There is also a trend towards stable product teams that extend their responsibilities beyond those of <em>just</em> the development of a solution or service.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agile transformation has stalled during the second wave in many companies.
Only individual elements of the third wave, such as portfolio management, have been tackled.
At the same time, transformation has often only occurred on the surface; the company’s DNA and culture have not (yet) adapted to the new era.
Executives must now take on the hard topics, such as new organizational forms, management behaviour, dedicated agile executives.
They must make difficult and painful decisions regarding new leadership teams.</p>

<p>Agile approaches are steadily making progress in Switzerland.
We have reached the level where late majority and laggards are slowly looking at the approach.
Low-hanging fruits were collected.
The next gains require deeper changes.
Progress is slow and resistance is very high.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Collaborators are happy with the change and do not want to go back to the old world.
However, the change often does not go beyond a first application of the methodology.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lately, I was asked which new approaches should be used for agile requirements engineering.
Did we find a new silver bullet to write software specifications the agile way?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The answer is an easy one.
We do not need new approaches or complicated processes.
Start with proven principles and learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.impactmapping.org/">Impact Mapping</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">Story Mapping</a>
are successful approaches to identify and prioritize your functions.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example">Specification by Example</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">User Stories</a>
as a discussion allow you to refine your understanding of what your customers need.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing">Acceptance Testing</a> verifies the implementation fulfills the expected behavior.
You get the mechanism to avoid regression problems when releasing your application for free.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The associated theory was published in seminal books more than a <strong>decade</strong> ago.
Just start applying the principles.
You can later still improve your approach based on your learnings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A nice overview was published in the <em>Professional Product Owner</em> [<a href="#professional-product-owner">1</a>] written by the stewards of the product owner certification path of <a href="https://www.scrum.org">Scrum.org</a>.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_approach">Approach</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_specification">Specification</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use Impact mapping and story mapping to classify and order your functionality.
Story mapping works hand in hand with the release plan artifact I cited in a previous post.
You have not only the key functionality you want to deliver, but also a tentative plan when you will deliver them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vision, roadmap, and release plan are needed artefacts for any product development using Scrum as a development approach.
The mapping identifies the stories to realize in a release to satisfy the customer’s needs.
A nice discussion of these concepts can be found in <em>Strategize</em> [<a href="#strategize">2</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The nice think is that impact mapping and story mapping are quite compatible with design thinking.
We can nicely connect the different directions used in agile product development and marketing departments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each specification story has acceptance criteria.
These criteria are the specifications of your product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum community clearly states that product backlog items are not specifications.
They are work items for the Scrum team.
If you want to use stories to describe your needs instead of the specification by example approach, it is OK, but please not in the backlog.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_validation">Validation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Acceptance criteria is a form of specification by example.
Acceptance tests - see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_test%E2%80%93driven_development">ATDD</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a> - are the automatic check for specification by example.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock left">
<div class="content">
<img src="../pics/2021-04-03-test-pyramid.png" alt="2021 04 03 test pyramid" width="420" height="360"/>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The gain of implementing the acceptance criteria as ATDD is guaranteed elimination of regression issues.
You also get automatic generation of test plans, test results and requirement documents.
Your documents are always in sync with the source code of your product.
An additional advantage is all these artifacts are under source code management and fully auditable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had success with <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/fitness-function-driven-development">Fitness Functions</a>
to describe and validate non-functional requirements.
We recommend taking this approach.
You can extend your automatic validation to non-functional requirements with the same mechanisms as for functional requirements.</p>

<p>I am working with teams developing software products in academic and small-company environments.
The needs boil down to</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide docker images to developers.
The images shall be accessible from the company Intranet and often form the Internet,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide virtual images only exceptionally,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide git repositories,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide development tools such as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket solutions including Pages for documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most often, virtual images are only needed when the user needs a Microsoft or macOS environment.
All Unix related requests are serviced through docker images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A need trend is the need to provide GPU capabilities for machine learning, artificial intelligence and visualization products.
The image approach is still working.
The current major challenge is the immaturity of the software solutions to share efficiently physical GPU.
I expect viable standard solutions will be available in the next two years.</p>

<h3 id="_next_steps">Next Steps</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implement a kiosk self-service solution for all regular requests of collaborators and students.</p>

<p>PMI realized a few years ago, their standard approach to project management was losing ground in the software industry.</p>

If you want to persist an instance having fields based on collections, you must use the <em>eager</em> mode.

<p>In-memory file systems are a must for unit and integration testing.
A continuous integration pipeline does not always have access to a regular file system.
Disk-based file systems are too slow for automatic testing

<p>We migrate with full success all our unit tests to use in-memory file systems in January 2021.
We use the <a href="https://github.com/google/jimfs">Jimfs</a> library.
When creating a Jimfs file system, you can specify whether it should imitate a UNIX- or Windows-style file system.
They differ in the naming conventions and attribute usage, so choose the one you prefer.
The Windows file system implements some Windows’ quirks, such as not permitting the creation of a file in the root directory.</p>

The <em>MicroStream</em> 4.x releases crash when using record in JDK 15 and JDK 16. It only works with JDK 14.
You are forced to use an obsolete JDK no more supported.
For example, the IntelliJ IDEA stops to provide support for obsolete JDKs as soon as the new official JDK release is available.
It hinders you to use the associated preview features

<a href="#_footnoteref_1">1</a>. I have reported the bug how they used path instances. The developers were very supportive. Version 4.01 supports in-memory file systems such as <a href="https://github.com/google/jimfs">Jimfs</a>.
</div>
<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_2">
<a href="#_footnoteref_2">2</a>. I have reported the bug in the microstream forum and informed them that their claim they support these JDK is plain wrong. The project sadly does not currently have a bug reporting system. I hope the version promised for April 2021 will finally solve these showstoppers.
</div>
<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_3">
<a href="#_footnoteref_3">3</a>. Version 5.0 was released July 2021 and finally provides support for records. You need to increase access to internal components with the option <em>--add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.misc=ALL-UNNAMED</em> to have a working approach.

<p>We learnt to deal with the new speed and how to tackle the laggards.
Some experiences were quite painful.
Below our findings and our current focus on developing software products.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_legibility_matters">Legibility Matters</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Programmers learnt the last decade that legibility and brevity of programming languages matter.
The Java <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/coin/">Coin</a> and <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/">Amber</a>
projects were initiated to reduce the verbosity of the Java language mainly through syntactic sugar.
A programmer should not be forced to write statements the compiler could infer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples of improvements are</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Diamond operators <em>to avoid writing two times the same generic parameter declarations</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try with resources <em>to avoid complicated finally blocks to close resources</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple catch of exceptions <em>to avoid writing multiple times the same error handling block</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>var</strong> local variables <em>to avoid complex declarations of local variables</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>default</strong> methods in interfaces <em>to avoid declaring the same method in multiple classes</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strings as switch selector <em>to write readable code instead of huge if statements</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Underscore in numerical constants <em>to increase legibility</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deeper changes are</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>New date API is simplifying the handling of date and time logic.
The solution is based on the learnings of the <a href="https://www.joda.org/joda-time/">Joda</a> time library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support of Lambda constructs greatly eliminates the need for verbose anonymous classes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_useful_constructs">Useful Constructs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modern Java has introduced powerful constructs to write legible and maintainable code.
Modern Java code is quite different from Java 5 code.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Java Modules</dt>
<dd>
<p>Dependencies management supported at language level.<br/>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)/">Ada</a> programming language has support for module since 1985.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Streams and Lambda</dt>
<dd>
<p>Support of functional programming approaches.
Streams are declarative and support internal iterators.<br/>
<em>The Booch Ada component library supported internal iterators since 1985</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Record</dt>
<dd>
<p>Very compact notation to define a data class and transparent handling of properties.
Records are immutable objects and finally use modern naming for getters
<sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_algebraic-types">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Sealed Types</dt>
<dd>
<p>Interesting way to restrict inheritance to a set of selected classes.
Very helpful for library designers.
You can publish an interface in the public API and limit the classes implementing this interface<sup class="footnoteref">[<a class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Reflection versus Lambda</dt>
<dd>
<p>References to methods and constructors are part of the lambda extension.
The <em>LambdaMetafactory</em> class allows you to create a reference at runtime.
The reflection operations can be replaced by lambda expressions.
The code is more performant and has security issues.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Text Blocks</dt>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The more complex approach is to replace all <em>File</em> objects with <em>Path</em> objects.
Ideally, the Java community should declare the <em>File</em> class as a deprecated one.
Another solution would be to extend File with an internal path instance.
This approach could break backward compatibility.</p>

<p>Technical agile coaching usefully describes the work I do.
Agile coaching helps your business to become more successful, often improve the way you plan and deliver software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Technical agile coaching focuses on how people design products, write code and deliver high-quality products.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My aim is the same as other agile coaches.
I improve the agility of the organizations I work with.
I use coaching, mentoring, teaching and facilitation techniques just as other coaches do.</p>

<p>My main focus is how the source code is written, the design defined, and the architecture formulated.</p>

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduce the distance between problems and problem-solvers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice <strong>Gemba</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take small steps, collect data, validate every step, update your approach.
Apply the <em>Plan-Do-Check-Act</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA">PDCA loop</a>.
Clean up as you go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lead and cycle-time are measures of the organizational agility.
Track them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not ask for permission when you want to continuously improve.
A professional is supposed to improve.
This is a core responsibility of your teams and team members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have the retrospectives to identify and plan your improvements.
You must allocate time for implementing the improvement in every sprint.
<a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum</a> is clear, at least one improvement measure is a high priority backlog item in the next sprint

<p>If you can choose, do <strong>not</strong> use SAFe.
I observe organizations struggling with SAFe’s over-standardized, phase-gated processes.
The top-down control generates waste in the value stream and discourages engineering talent creativity.
It seriously limits autonomy and experimentation in the teams.
It can promote silos in the organization, preventing platforms from becoming real business capabilities enablers.</p>

<h4 id="_cherry_picking">Cherry Picking</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cherry-picking in Git means choosing a commit from one branch and applying it onto another.
This is in contrast with other ways such as <em>merge</em> and <em>rebase</em> which normally apply many commits onto another branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can display the hashes of your commits in the <em>trunk</em> with the command:</p>

<p>Identifiers are a key concept to successfully model complex business domains.
They permeate how our modern civilization functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Could you imagine a country without car registration number of vehicles, internet addresses, postal addresses or social security numbers?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Identifiers are <strong>identifiers</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Identifiers cannot be changed at any time.
Updating identifiers means introducing mapping relations between the old and the new values.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In computer science, identifiers <em>IDs</em> are lexical tokens that name entities.<br/>
Identifiers are used extensively in virtually all information processing systems.<br/>
Identifying entities makes it possible to refer to them, which is essential for any kind of symbolic processing.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_external_well_defined_identifiers">External Well-Defined Identifiers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best identifiers are externally well-defined identifiers.
A unique and well-defined authority is responsible for defining and publishing them.
Ideally, the authorities should only create new identifiers and never delete existing ones.
The published information is available to all interested parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples are</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Currency names as defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">ISO standard 4217</a>.</p>

<p>Country abbreviations as defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes">ISO standard 3166</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social security numbers are well documented in the country they are used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Car numbers are well-known and documented.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Try to use global externally defined identifiers as much as possible.
Always document the authority in charge to create these identifiers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples you are using are</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>IBAN account numbers are defined worldwide through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number">ISO 13616</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank connections are defined as Business Identifier Codes through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9362">BIC ISO 9362</a>.
The registration authority is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication">SWIFT</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Car numbers and country acronyms are defined worldwide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passport numbers are defined worldwide.
Each country has its own structure and conventions.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You shall document the source of truth for all externally defined and managed identifiers.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_internal_managed_identifiers">Internal Managed Identifiers</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Variations are</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A full date as prefix, our system uses this convention to name invoices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A more readable acronym, our ERP system uses the word invoice to name invoices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beware if you export internal managed identifiers, you become a source of truth.
You are responsible for documenting these identifiers, and the process to create new ones.
You shall also guaranty that existing identifiers are never recycled.
If your identifiers are strings, you shall clearly define the supported languages, and character sets.</p>

<h3 id="_domain_driven_design"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">Domain Driven Design</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Domain Driven Design <em>DDD</em> is a powerful and modern approach to define agile software architecture.
Some key rules are related to identity.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Entity has a wel-defined identity</dt>
<dd>
<p>An entity is an object that is not defined by its attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and its identity.
Any instance of an entity abstraction must have a unique identifier.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Identify aggregate through identity</dt>
<dd>
<p>An aggregate is a group of objects that are bound together by a root entity, called the aggregate root.
Objects outside the aggregate are allowed to hold references to the root but not to any other object of the aggregate.
The aggregate root is responsible for checking the consistency of changes in the aggregate.
An aggregate is found and referenced through the identifier of the aggregate root entity.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Reference over aggregate through identity</dt>
<dd>
<p>An aggregate shall reference other aggregate through the identity of their root entity instance.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept of identity is therefore central to the domain driven design approach.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lessons_learnt">Lessons Learnt</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Always try to find an external, well-defined identifier for your entities.
Beware of legal aspects when you are using government defined identifiers such as social security numbers, passport numbers or car numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Avoid by all means to use an internal privately defined identifier as a public one.
You will bear the burden of documenting, manage and evolve the scheme as soon as you do this.</p>

<p>This post discusses the value object pattern, and the factory pattern which are tactical patterns in the domain driven design
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">DDD</a> approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Value objects represent typed values that have no conceptual identity in your domain.
They can help you write better codes that are less error-prone, more performant and more expressive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Value objects define the second kind of domain objects besides entities.
Their main characteristic is immutability:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Attributes of a value object <strong>never</strong> change</em>.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A second characteristic is that they do not have external identifiers.
Unlike an entity, two value objects with the exact same properties are considered equal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A third one is they should be self-validating.
A value object shall verify the validity of its attributes when being created.
If any of its attributes are invalid, the object should not be created and an error or exception should be raised.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object">Value Objects</a> do have attributes and methods as entities.
Attributes of value objects are immutable.
Methods of value objects can only be queries without side effects.
Operations never command a change to the internal state of a value object.
We can pass value objects to clients without worrying they change them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many objects can be modeled as value objects instead of entities because they are defined through their attributes.
These objects measure, quantify or describe things in the domain model.
Because they are so easy to handle, we should model domain abstractions as value objects as often as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_addresses_phone_numbers_email_addresses">Addresses, Phone Numbers, Email Addresses</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some value objects are part of any commercial application domain.
Postal addresses, phone numbers and email addresses are canonical value objects.
Other candidates are bank account IBAN numbers, job titles, job descriptions, company legal status.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means that these objects do not have an object identifier and should not be stored in a separate table if stored in an SQL database.
Value objects shall be embedded objects and be part of an object such as a person.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A person is an entity.
It should have an external identifier and has a postal address, multiple phone numbers, and one or more email addresses.</p>

<p>Check your domain model and validate these assumptions.</p>

<li>
<p>They are immutable objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business processes can replace such an object with a new instance without impeding other domain instances.</p>

As a bonus, you get the <strong>hashCode</strong> and <strong>equals</strong> methods for free.</p>

<p>To complicate matter, invoice lines have different types, such as a regular line with a specific article, quantity, unit price and computed price.
Often VAT aspects must be considered and computed for the overall invoice.
An invoice line can also be a subtotal for a set of regular invoice lines.</p>

<p>Serialization libraries such as JSON Jackson library cannot handle invoice lines with multiple Java class types.
A workable approach is described and implemented with the open source component <a href="http://blog.tangly.net/docs/gleam/">Gleam</a>.
The solution is to define selectors to instantiate the correct Java class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invoices are complex objects and ideal candidates for a document-oriented persistent approach.
Invoices should not be stored in a relation based persistence store, meaning an SQL database.
To store them in a table, you have to model the various types of lines and add a technical identifier to each invoice line instance.</p>

<h3 id="_factories">Factories</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The factory pattern in Domain Driven Design <em>DDD</em> can be seen as a super pattern for the Gang of Four (GoF) creation patterns.
Factories are concerned with creating new entities and value objects.
They also validate the invariants for the newly created objects.
We can place a factory on the entity or value object itself or on an independent object.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Factories that are declared on the same object they create are either factory methods or prototype methods.
