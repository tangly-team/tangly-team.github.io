      <description>Functional programming is hype for the last ten years.&#xA;All popular programming languages have added support to functional concepts for years.&#xA;Not all developers are embracing the new approach and using the provided constructs.&#xA;I often have to read source code which uses only idioms defined in the last millennium. I cringed and asked myself why developers are writing such awkward code?&#xA;What does it mean to code with functional paradigms?</description>

      <description>Functional programming is hype for the last ten years. You find a lot of blogs and videos stating object-oriented languages are doomed.&#xA;Almost all most popular languages have added some support to functional concepts in the last years.&#xA;Java introduced lambda expressions and single abstract method interfaces SAM with Java 8 in March 2014. Java developers are empowered to write functional code for almost ten years.&#xA;Other languages such as Python, C++ or C# added their own functional extensions in newer revisions.</description>
