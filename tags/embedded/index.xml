      <title>Domain-Driven Design with ROS-2</title>

      <description>At its core, Robot Operation System provides a message-passing system, often called middleware.&#xA;Communication is one of the first needs to arise when implementing a new robot application, or really any software system that will interact with hardware. ROSâ€™s built-in and well-tested messaging system saves you time by managing the details of communication between distributed nodes via an anonymous Publish and Subscribe Pattern.&#xA;This approach encourages good practices in your software development, including fault isolation, Seperation of Concerns, and clear interfaces.</description>

      <description>The actor library defines the actor abstraction with mailboxes and concrete implementation for various target platforms.&#xA;The CMSIS-RTOS v2 platform provides an actor implementation for all realtime kernels supporting the CMSIS API. The API is under the stewardship of ARM company.&#xA;Any kernel with a CMSIS-RTOS v2 compatible layer is eligible.&#xA;STM provides the CMSIS integration with freeRTOS for all STM32 microcontrollers.&#xA;Library The library defines key abstractions as abstract classes [1] [2].</description>

      <title>Bus Sensors and Actuators</title>

      <description>Your embedded system has a set of sensors and actors.&#xA;Some sensors and actors are connected to a bus. Typical buses are CAN bus, Serial Peripherical Interface, Ethernet, Bluetooth, or I2C standards.&#xA;The bus is a shared medium used to communicate with a set of external active or passive components.&#xA;Which design rules shall you follow when designing sensors and actors using a bus architecture?&#xA;Do you need to consider threading design?</description>

      <description>Embedded design maps domain abstractions to the underlying hardware.&#xA;A temperature sensor is a domain abstraction of a physical hardware temperature sensor.&#xA;A valve is a domain abstraction of a physical hardware valve. A physical valve can be a simple opened-closed device, or a proportional device.&#xA;The microcontroller board reads the temperature sensor through an I2C or SPI bus. It controls the valve through a GPIO, a PWM or a CAN bus controller.</description>
