      <description>Historically, big beats small. Scale was a sufficient advantage to be successful in the market.&#xA;Now, fast and adaptive beats slow and steadfast.&#xA;New technologies, evolving customer preferences and changing employee expectations are fundamentally challenging established ways of working [1].&#xA;It is time to move beyond rigid hierarchies, siloed business units, crippling bureaucracy and an increasingly unwieldy matrix.&#xA;Agile organizations combine the efficiencies of scale with the speed, flexibility and resilience to compete and win in todayâ€™s world.</description>

      <description>I long dreamed of working in a digital environment. I shall no longer print out a form, sign it by hand and use snake mail to deliver it to the receiving party. All company documents are stored electronically. I can search any artifacts by content and get a list of all interesting items in seconds.&#xA;Our software service company is an ideal candidate to validate if this assumption is realistic.</description>

      <description>It is Spring in Switzerland. We often have time for small talk because it is cold or rainy outside.&#xA;Quite a few of the discussions are about job opportunities, and how interesting and motivating the current activities are.&#xA;I selected two articles to help everybody to decide if your software development job is worth the effort.&#xA;Go through the questions and ask yourself if the current product provides the current settings.</description>

      <title>Found a Limited Liability Company in Switzerland</title>

The legal Swiss institutions, such as taxes, social insurances, and accident insurances are challenging and almost unfair with freelancers.</description>
